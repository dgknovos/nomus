<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">K, a Canadian, has been detained by the U.S. military at
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, since 2002, when he was a minor.&nbsp; In 2004, he was charged
with war crimes, but the U.S. trial is still pending.&nbsp; In 2003, agents from two
Canadian intelligence services, CSIS and DFAIT, questioned K on matters
connected to the charges pending against him, and shared the product of these
interviews with U.S. authorities.&nbsp; In 2004, a DFAIT official interviewed K
again, with knowledge that he had been subjected by U.S. authorities to a sleep
deprivation technique, known as the &#147;frequent flyer program&#148;, to make him less
resistant to interrogation.&nbsp; In 2008, in <I>Khadr v. Canada</I> (&#147;<I>Khadr 2008</I>&#148;),
this Court held that the regime in place at Guantanamo Bay constituted a clear
violation of Canada&#146;s international human rights obligations, and, under
s.&nbsp;7 of the <I>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</I>, ordered the
Canadian government to disclose to K the transcripts of the interviews he had
given to CSIS and DFAIT, which it did.&nbsp; After repeated requests by K that the
Canadian government seek his repatriation, the Prime Minister announced his
decision not to do so.&nbsp; K then applied to the Federal Court for judicial
review, alleging that the decision violated his rights under s.&nbsp;7 of the <I>Charter</I>.&nbsp;
The Federal Court held that under the special circumstances of this case,
Canada had a duty to protect K under s.&nbsp;7 of the <I>Charter</I> and
ordered the government to request his repatriation.&nbsp; The Federal Court of
Appeal upheld the order, but stated that the s.&nbsp;7 breach arose from the
interrogation conducted in 2004 with the knowledge that K had been subjected to
the &#147;frequent flyer program&#148;.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;"><I>Held</I>:&nbsp;&nbsp;The

<DIV class="Section6">

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">Canada actively participated in a process contrary to
its international human rights obligations and contributed to K&#146;s ongoing
detention so as to deprive him of his right to liberty and security of the
person, guaranteed by s.&nbsp;7 of the <I>Charter</I>, not in accordance with
the principles of fundamental justice.&nbsp; Though the process to which K is
subject has changed, his claim is based upon the same underlying series of
events considered in <I>Khadr</I> <I>2008</I>.&nbsp; As held in that case, the <I>Charter</I>
applies to the participation of Canadian officials in a regime later found to
be in violation of fundamental rights protected by international law.&nbsp; There is
a sufficient connection between the government&#146;s participation in the illegal
process and the deprivation of K&#146;s liberty and security of the person.&nbsp; While
the U.S. is the primary source of the deprivation, it is reasonable to infer
from the uncontradicted evidence before the Court that the statements taken by
Canadian officials are contributing to K&#146;s continued detention.&nbsp; The
deprivation of K&#146;s right to liberty and security of the person is not in
accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.&nbsp; The interrogation of a
youth detained without access to counsel, to elicit statements about serious
criminal charges while knowing that the youth had been subjected to sleep
deprivation and while knowing that the fruits of the interrogations would be
shared with the prosecutors, offends the most basic Canadian standards about
the treatment of detained youth suspects. </P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">K is entitled to a remedy under s.&nbsp;24(1) of the <I>Charter</I>.&nbsp;
The remedy sought by K &#151; an order that Canada request his repatriation &#151; is
sufficiently connected to the <I>Charter</I> breach that occurred in 2003 and
2004 because of the continuing effect of this breach into the present and its
possible effect on K&#146;s ultimate trial.&nbsp; While the government must have
flexibility in deciding how its duties under the royal prerogative over foreign
relations are discharged, the executive is not exempt from constitutional
scrutiny.&nbsp; Courts have the jurisdiction and the duty to determine whether a
prerogative power asserted by the Crown exists; if so, whether its exercise
infringes the <I>Charter</I> or other constitutional norms; and, where
necessary, to give specific direction to the executive branch of the
government.&nbsp; Here, the trial judge misdirected himself in ordering the
government to request K&#146;s repatriation, in view of the constitutional
responsibility of the executive to make decisions on matters of foreign affairs
and the inconclusive state of the record.&nbsp; The appropriate remedy in this case
is to declare that K&#146;s <I>Charter</I> rights were violated, leaving it to the
government to decide how best to respond in light of current information, its
responsibility over foreign affairs, and the <I>Charter</I>. </P>

</SPAN>Omar Khadr, a Canadian citizen, has been detained by the United
States government at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for over seven years.&nbsp; The Prime
Minister asks this Court to&nbsp; reverse the decision of the Federal Court of
Appeal requiring the Canadian government to request the United States to return
Mr. Khadr from Guantanamo Bay to Canada.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt; ">[2]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
</SPAN>For the reasons that follow, we agree with the courts below that
Mr. Khadr&#146;s rights under s. 7 of the <I>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</I>
were violated. However, we conclude that the order made by the lower courts
that the government request Mr. Khadr&#146;s return to Canada is not an appropriate
remedy for that breach under s. 24(1) of the <I>Charter</I>. Consistent with
the separation of powers and the well-grounded reluctance of courts to
intervene in matters of foreign relations, the proper remedy is to grant Mr.
Khadr a declaration that his <I>Charter</I> rights have been infringed, while
leaving the government a measure of discretion in deciding how best to respond.
We would therefore allow the appeal in part.</P>

</SPAN>Mr. Khadr was 15 years old when he was taken prisoner on July 27,
2002, by U.S. forces in Afghanistan. He was alleged to have thrown a grenade
that killed an American soldier in the battle in which he was captured.&nbsp; About
three months later, he was transferred to the U.S. military installation at
Guantanamo Bay. He was placed in adult detention facilities.&nbsp; </P>

</SPAN>On September 7, 2004, Mr. Khadr was brought before a Combatant
Status Review Tribunal which affirmed a previous determination that he was an
&#147;enemy combatant&#148;. He was subsequently charged with war crimes and held for
trial before a military commission. In light of a number of procedural delays
and setbacks, that trial is still pending.</P>

Intelligence Service (&#147;CSIS&#148;) and the Foreign Intelligence Division of the
Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (&#147;DFAIT&#148;) questioned Mr.
Khadr on matters connected to the charges pending against him and shared the
product of these interviews with U.S. authorities. In March 2004, a DFAIT
official interviewed Mr. Khadr again, with the knowledge that he had been
subjected by U.S. authorities to a sleep deprivation technique, known as the &#147;frequent
flyer program&#148;, in an effort to make him less resistant to interrogation.&nbsp;
During this interview, Mr. Khadr refused to answer questions. In 2005, von
Finckenstein J. of the Federal Court issued an interim injunction preventing
CSIS and DFAIT agents from further interviewing Mr.&nbsp;Khadr in order &#147;to
prevent a potential grave injustice&#148; from occurring: <I>Khadr v. Canada</I>,
2005 FC 1076, [2006] 2 F.C.R. 505, at para. 46.&nbsp; In 2008, this Court ordered
the Canadian government to disclose to Mr. Khadr the transcripts of the
interviews he had given to CSIS and DFAIT in Guantanamo Bay, under s. 7 of the <I>Charter</I>:<I>

</SPAN>After reviewing the history of Mr. Khadr&#146;s detention and

that in these special circumstances, Canada has a &#147;duty to protect&#148; Mr. Khadr
(2009 FC 405, 341 F.T.R. 300). He found that &#147;[t]he ongoing refusal of Canada
to request Mr. Khadr&#146;s repatriation to Canada offends a principle of
fundamental justice and violates Mr. Khadr&#146;s rights under s. 7 of the <I>Charter</I>&#148;
(para. 92). Also, he held that &#147;[t]o mitigate the effect of that violation,
Canada must present a request to the United States for Mr. Khadr&#146;s repatriation
to Canada as soon as practicable&#148; (para. 92).</P>

narrowly.&nbsp; The majority of the Court of Appeal found that it arose from the
March 2004 interrogation conducted with the knowledge that Mr.&nbsp;Khadr had
been subject to the &#147;frequent flyer program&#148;, characterized by the majority as
involving cruel and abusive treatment contrary to the principles of fundamental
justice: 2009 FCA 246, 310 D.L.R. (4th) 462.&nbsp; Dissenting, Nadon J.A. reviewed
the many steps the government had taken on Mr.&nbsp;Khadr&#146;s behalf and held

</SPAN>Mr. Khadr does not suggest that the government is obliged to
request the repatriation of all Canadian citizens held abroad in suspect
circumstances.&nbsp; Rather, his contention is that the conduct of the government of
Canada in connection with his detention by the U.S. military in Guantanamo Bay,
and in particular Canada&#146;s collaboration with the U.S. government in 2003 and
2004, violated his rights under the <I>Charter</I>, and requires as a remedy
that the government now request his return to Canada.&nbsp; The issues that flow

</SPAN>&nbsp;This question was addressed in <I>Khadr 2008</I>, in which<I> </I>this
Court held that the <I>Charter </I>applied to the actions of Canadian officials
operating at Guantanamo Bay who handed the fruits of their interviews over to
U.S. authorities.&nbsp; This Court held, at para. 26, that &#147;the principles of
international law and comity that might otherwise preclude application of the <I>Charter</I>
to Canadian officials acting abroad do not apply to the assistance they gave to
U.S. authorities at Guantanamo Bay&#148;, given holdings of the Supreme Court of the
United States that the military commission regime then in place constituted a
clear violation of fundamental human rights protected by international law: see
<I>Khadr 2008</I>, at para. 24, <I>Rasul v. Bush</I>, 542 U.S. 466 (2004), and <I>Hamdan
v. Rumsfeld</I>, 126 S. Ct. 2749 (2006).&nbsp;&nbsp; The principles of fundamental
justice thus required the Canadian officials who had interrogated Mr. Khadr to
disclose to him the contents of the statements he had given them.&nbsp; The Canadian
government complied with this Court&#146;s order.</P>

</SPAN>We note that the regime under which Mr. Khadr is currently
detained has changed significantly in recent years.&nbsp; The U.S. Congress has
legislated and the U.S. courts have acted with the aim of bringing the military
processes at Guantanamo Bay in line with international law.&nbsp; (The <I>Detainee
Treatment Act of 2005</I>, Pub. L. 109-148, 119 Stat. 2739, prohibited inhumane
treatment of detainees and required interrogations to be performed according to
the Army field manual.&nbsp; The <I>Military Commissions Act of 2006</I>, Pub. L.
109-366, 120 Stat. 2600, attempted to legalize the Guantanamo regime after the
U.S. Supreme Court&#146;s ruling in <I>Hamdan v. Rumsfeld</I>.&nbsp; However, on June 12,
2008, in <I>Boumediene v. Bush</I>, 128 S. Ct. 2229 (2008), the U.S. Supreme
Court held that Guantanamo Bay detainees have a constitutional right to <I>habeas

of 2006</I> that suspended that right.) </P>

</SPAN>Though the process to which Mr. Khadr is subject has changed, his
claim is based upon the same underlying series of events at Guantanamo Bay (the
interviews and evidence-sharing of 2003 and 2004) that we considered in <I>Khadr
2008</I>. We are satisfied that the rationale in <I>Khadr 2008 </I>for applying

</SPAN>The United States is holding Mr. Khadr for the purpose of trying

the deprivation of Mr. Khadr&#146;s liberty and security of the person.&nbsp; However,

his past and continuing deprivation of liberty.&nbsp; To satisfy the requirements of
s. 7, as stated by this Court in <I>Suresh v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship
and Immigration)</I>, 2002 SCC 1,<I> </I>[2002] 1 S.C.R. 3, there must be &#147;a

</SPAN>The record suggests that the interviews conducted by CSIS and
DFAIT provided significant evidence in relation to these charges.&nbsp; During the
February and September 2003 interrogations, CSIS officials repeatedly
questioned Mr. Khadr about the central events at issue in his prosecution,
extracting statements from him that could potentially prove inculpatory in the
U.S. proceedings against him (CSIS Document, Exhibit &#147;U&#148; to Affidavit of Lt.
Cdr. William Kuebler, November 7, 2003 (J.R., vol. II, at p. 280); Interview
Summary, Exhibit &#147;AA&#148; to Affidavit of Lt. Cdr. William Kuebler, February 24,

Interview Summary, Exhibit &#147;DD&#148; to Affidavit of Lt. Cdr. William Kuebler, April
20, 2004 (J.R., vol. III, at p. 296)).&nbsp; A report of the Security Intelligence
Review Committee titled <I>CSIS&#146;s Role in the Matter of Omar Khadr</I> (July 8,
2009), further indicated that CSIS assessed the interrogations of Mr. Khadr as
being &#147;highly successful, as evidenced by the quality of intelligence
information&#148; elicited from Mr. Khadr (p. 13).&nbsp; These statements were&nbsp; shared
with U.S. authorities and were summarized in U.S. investigative reports (Report
of Investigative Activity, Exhibit &#147;AA&#148; to Affidavit of Lt. Cdr. William
Kuebler, February 24, 2003 (J.R., vol. III, at pp. 289 ff.)).&nbsp; Pursuant to the
relaxed rules of evidence under the U.S. <I>&nbsp;Military Commissions Act of 2006</I>,
Mr. Khadr&#146;s statements to Canadian officials are potentially admissible against
him in the U.S. proceedings, notwithstanding the oppressive circumstances under
which they were obtained: see <I>United States of America v. Mohammed Jawad</I>,
Military Commission, September 24, 2008, D-008 Ruling on defense Motion to
Dismiss &#151; Torture of detainee (online:&nbsp; http://www.defense.gov/news/Ruling%20D&#8209;008.pdf
).&nbsp; The above interrogations also provided the context for the March 2004
interrogation, when a DFAIT official, knowing that Mr. Khadr had been subjected
to the &#147;frequent flyer program&#148; to make him less resistant to interrogations,
nevertheless proceeded with the interrogation of Mr. Khadr (Interview Summary,
Exhibit &#147;DD&#148; to Affidavit of Lt. Cdr. William Kuebler, April 20, 2004 (J.R.,

</SPAN>We conclude that Canadian conduct in connection with Mr. Khadr&#146;s
case&nbsp; did not conform to the principles of fundamental justice. That conduct
may be briefly reviewed.&nbsp; The statements taken by CSIS and DFAIT were obtained
through participation&nbsp; in a regime which was known at the time to have refused
detainees the right to challenge the legality of detention by way of <I>habeas
corpus.</I> It was also known that Mr. Khadr was 16 years old at the time and
that he had not had access to counsel or to any adult who had his best
interests in mind. As held by this Court in&nbsp; <I>Khadr 2008</I>, Canada&#146;s
participation in the illegal process in place at Guantanamo Bay clearly
violated Canada&#146;s binding international obligations (<I>Khadr 2008</I>, at
paras. 23-25; <I>Hamdan v. Rumsfeld</I>).&nbsp; In conducting their interviews, CSIS
officials had control over the questions asked and the subject matter of the
interviews (Transcript of cross-examination on Affidavit of Mr.&nbsp;Hopper,
Exhibit &#147;GG&#148; to Affidavit of Lt. Cdr. William Kuebler, March 2, 2005 (J.R.,
vol. III, at p. 313, at p. 22)). Canadian officials also knew that the U.S.
authorities would have full access to the contents of the interrogations (as
Canadian officials sought no restrictions on their use) by virtue of their
audio and video recording (<I>CSIS&#146;s Role in the Matter of Omar Khadr</I>, at
pp. 11-12).&nbsp; The purpose of the interviews was for intelligence gathering and
not criminal investigation.&nbsp; While in some contexts there may be an important
distinction between those interviews conducted for the purpose of intelligence
gathering and those conducted in criminal investigations, here, the distinction
loses its significance.&nbsp; Canadian officials questioned Mr. Khadr on matters
that may have provided important evidence relating to his criminal proceedings,
in circumstances where they knew that Mr. Khadr was being indefinitely
detained, was a young person and was alone during the interrogations.&nbsp; Further,
the March 2004 interview, where Mr. Khadr refused to answer questions, was
conducted knowing that Mr. Khadr had been subjected to three weeks of scheduled
sleep deprivation, a measure described by the U.S. Military Commission in <I>Jawad</I>
as designed to &#147;make [detainees] more compliant and break down their resistance
to interrogation&#148; (para. 4).&nbsp; </P>

to him.&nbsp; The Federal Court of Appeal held that he did not abuse his remedial
discretion.&nbsp; On the basis of our answer to the second of the foregoing

the exercise of his discretion in granting the remedy sought.</P>

</SPAN>First, is the remedy sought sufficiently connected to the breach?
We have concluded that the Canadian government breached Mr. Khadr&#146;s s.&nbsp;7
rights in 2003 and 2004 through its participation in the then-illegal military
regime at Guantanamo Bay.&nbsp; The question at this point is whether the remedy now
being sought &#151; an order that the Canadian government ask the United States to
return Mr. Khadr to Canada &#151; is appropriate and just in the circumstances.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt; ">[30]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">
</SPAN>An appropriate and just remedy is &#147;one that meaningfully
vindicates the rights and freedoms of the claimants&#148;: <I>Doucet-Boudreau v.
Nova Scotia (Minister of Education)</I>, 2003 SCC 62,<I> </I>[2003] 3 S.C.R. 3,
at para. 55. The first hurdle facing Mr. Khadr, therefore, is to establish a
sufficient connection between the breaches of s.&nbsp;7 that occurred in 2003
and 2004 and the order sought in these judicial review proceedings. In our
view, the sufficiency of this connection is established by the continuing
effect of these breaches into the present.&nbsp; Mr. Khadr&#146;s <I>Charter</I> rights
were breached when Canadian officials contributed to his detention by virtue of
their interrogations at Guantanamo Bay knowing Mr. Khadr was a youth, did not have
access to legal counsel or <I>habeas</I> <I>corpus</I> at that time and, at the
time of the interview in March 2004, had been subjected to improper treatment
by the U.S. authorities.&nbsp; As the information obtained by Canadian officials
during the course of their interrogations may be used in the U.S. proceedings
against Mr. Khadr, the effect of the breaches cannot be said to have been
spent.&nbsp; It continues to this day.&nbsp; As discussed earlier, the material that
Canadian officials gathered and turned over to the U.S. military authorities
may form part of the case upon which he is currently being held.&nbsp; The evidence
before us suggests that the material produced was relevant and useful.&nbsp; There
has been no suggestion that it does not form part of the case against Mr. Khadr
or that it will not be put forward at his ultimate trial. We therefore find
that the breach of Mr. Khadr&#146;s s. 7 <I>Charter </I>rights remains ongoing and
that the remedy sought could potentially vindicate those rights. </P>

</SPAN>The acts that perpetrated the <I>Charter</I> breaches relied on
in this appeal lie in the past.&nbsp; But their impact on Mr. Khadr&#146;s liberty and
security continue to this day and may redound into the future.&nbsp; The impact of
the breaches is thus perpetuated into the present.&nbsp; When past acts violate
present liberties, a present remedy may be required.</P>

</SPAN>Second, is the remedy sought precluded by the fact that it
touches on the Crown prerogative over foreign affairs?&nbsp; A connection between
the remedy and the breach is not the only consideration.&nbsp; As stated in <I>Doucet-Boudreau</I>,
an appropriate and just remedy is also one that &#147;must employ means that are
legitimate within the framework of our constitutional democracy&#148; (para. 56) and
must be a &#147;judicial one which vindicates the right while invoking the function
and powers of a court&#148; (para. 57).&nbsp; The government argues that courts have no power
under the Constitution of Canada to require the executive branch of government
to do anything in the area of foreign policy.&nbsp; It submits that the decision not
to request the repatriation of Mr. Khadr falls directly within the prerogative
powers of the Crown to conduct foreign relations, including the right to speak
freely with a foreign state on all such matters: P.&nbsp;W. Hogg, <I>Constitutional
Law of Canada</I> (5th ed. Supp.), at p. 1&#8209;19.</P>

</SPAN>The prerogative power is&nbsp; the &#147;residue of discretionary or

the Constitution</I> (8th ed. 1915), at p. 420. It is a limited source of non&#8209;statutory
administrative power accorded by the common law to the Crown: Hogg, at p.

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt; ">[35]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">
</SPAN>The prerogative power over foreign affairs has not been displaced
by s.&nbsp;10 of the <I>Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade
Act</I>, R.S.C. 1985, c. E&#8209;22, and continues to be exercised by the
federal government. The Crown prerogative in foreign affairs includes the
making of representations to a foreign government: <I>Black v. Canada (Prime
Minister) </I>(2001), 199 D.L.R. (4th) 228 (Ont. C.A.). We therefore agree with
O&#146;Reilly J.&#146;s implicit finding (paras. 39, 40 and 49) that the decision not to
request Mr.&nbsp;Khadr&#146;s repatriation was made in the exercise of the
prerogative over foreign relations. </P>

</SPAN>In exercising its common law powers under the royal prerogative,
the executive is not exempt from constitutional scrutiny: <I>Operation
Dismantle v. The Queen</I>, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 441.&nbsp; It is for the executive and not
the courts to decide whether and how to exercise its powers, but the courts
clearly have the jurisdiction and the duty to determine whether a prerogative
power asserted by the Crown does in fact exist and, if so, whether its exercise
infringes the <I>Charter</I> (<I>Operation Dismantle</I>) or other
constitutional norms (<I>Air Canada v. British Columbia (Attorney General)</I>,
[1986] 2 S.C.R. 539).&nbsp; </P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt; ">[37]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">
</SPAN>The limited power of the courts to review exercises of the
prerogative power for constitutionality reflects the fact that in a
constitutional democracy, all government power must be exercised in accordance
with the Constitution.&nbsp; This said, judicial review of the exercise of the
prerogative power for constitutionality remains sensitive to the fact that the
executive branch of government is responsible for decisions under this power,
and that the executive is better placed to make such decisions within a range
of constitutional options. The government must have flexibility in deciding how
its duties under the power are to be discharged: see, e.g., <I>Reference re
Secession of Quebec</I>, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 217, at paras. 101-2. But it is for
the courts to determine the legal and constitutional limits within which such
decisions are to be taken. It follows that in the case of refusal by a
government to abide by constitutional constraints, courts are empowered to make
orders ensuring that the government&#146;s foreign affairs prerogative is exercised
in accordance with the constitution: <I>United States v. Burns</I>, 2001 SCC 7,
[2001] 1 S.C.R. 283. </P>

</SPAN>Having concluded that the courts possess a narrow power to review
and intervene on matters of foreign affairs to ensure the constitutionality of
executive action, the final question is whether O&#146;Reilly J. misdirected himself
in exercising that power in the circumstances of this case (<I>R. v. Bjelland</I>,
2009 SCC 38, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 651, at para. 15; <I>R. v. Regan</I>, 2002 SCC 12,
[2002] 1 S.C.R. 297, at paras. 117&#8209;18).&nbsp; (In fairness to the trial judge,
we note that the government proposed no alternative (trial judge&#146;s reasons, at
para. 78).)&nbsp; If the record and legal principle support his decision, deference
requires we not interfere.&nbsp; However, in our view that is not the case.</P>

</SPAN>Our first concern is that the remedy ordered below gives too
little weight to the constitutional responsibility of the executive to make
decisions on matters of foreign affairs in the context of complex and
ever-changing circumstances, taking into account Canada&#146;s broader national
interests. For the following reasons, we conclude that the appropriate remedy
is to declare that, on the record before the Court, Canada infringed Mr.
Khadr&#146;s s. 7 rights, and to leave it to the government to decide how best to
respond to this judgment in light of current information, its responsibility
for foreign affairs, and in conformity with the <I>Charter</I>.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt; ">[40]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">
</SPAN>As discussed, the conduct of foreign affairs lies with the
executive branch of government. The courts, however, are charged with adjudicating
the claims of individuals who claim that their <I>Charter </I>rights have been
or will be violated by the exercise of the government&#146;s discretionary powers: <I>Operation
Dismantle</I>.&nbsp; </P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt; ">[41]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">
</SPAN>In some situations, courts may give specific directions to the
executive branch of the government on matters touching foreign policy.&nbsp; For
example, in <I>&nbsp;Burns</I>, the Court held that it would offend s. 7 to
extradite a fugitive from Canada without seeking and obtaining assurances from
the requesting state that the death penalty would not be imposed.&nbsp; The Court
gave due weight to the fact that seeking and obtaining those assurances were
matters of Canadian foreign relations.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it ordered that the
government seek them.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt; ">[42]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">
</SPAN>The specific facts in <I>Burns</I> justified a more specific
remedy.&nbsp; The fugitives were under the control of Canadian officials. It was
clear that&nbsp; assurances would provide effective protection against the
prospective <I>Charter</I> breaches: it was entirely within Canada&#146;s power to
protect the fugitives against possible execution.&nbsp; Moreover, the Court noted
that no public purpose would be served by extradition without assurances that
would not be substantially served by extradition with assurances, and that
there was nothing to suggest that seeking such assurances would undermine
Canada&#146;s good relations with other states: <I>Burns</I>, at paras. 125 and
136.&nbsp; </P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt; ">[43]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">
</SPAN>The present case differs from <I>Burns</I>.&nbsp; Mr. Khadr is not
under the control of the Canadian government; the likelihood that the proposed
remedy will be effective is unclear; and the impact on Canadian foreign
relations of a repatriation request cannot be properly assessed by the Court.&nbsp; </P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt; ">[44]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">
</SPAN>This brings us to our second concern: the inadequacy of the
record.&nbsp; The record before us gives a necessarily incomplete picture of the
range of considerations currently faced by the government in assessing Mr.
Khadr&#146;s request. We do not know what negotiations may have taken place, or will
take place, between the U.S. and Canadian governments over the fate of Mr.
Khadr. As observed by Chaskalson C.J. in <I>Kaunda v. President of the Republic
of South Africa</I>, [2004] ZACC 5, 136 I.L.R. 452: &#147;The timing of
representations if they are to be made, the language in which they should be
couched, and the sanctions (if any) which should follow if such representations
are rejected are matters with which courts are ill-equipped to deal&#148; (para.
77).&nbsp; It follows that in these circumstances, it would not be appropriate for
the Court to give direction as to the diplomatic steps necessary to address the
breaches of Mr. Khadr&#146;s <I>Charter</I> rights.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt; ">[45]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">
</SPAN>Though Mr. Khadr has not been moved from Guantanamo Bay in over
seven years, his legal predicament continues to evolve. During the hearing of
this appeal, we were advised by counsel that the U.S. Department of Justice had
decided that Mr. Khadr will continue to face trial by military commission,
though other Guantanamo detainees will now be tried in a federal court in New
York. How this latest development will affect Mr. Khadr&#146;s situation and any
ongoing negotiations between the United States and Canada over his possible
repatriation is unknown. But it signals caution in the exercise of the Court&#146;s
remedial jurisdiction.</P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt; ">[46]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">
</SPAN>In this case, the evidentiary uncertainties, the limitations of
the Court&#146;s institutional competence, and the need to respect the prerogative
powers of the executive, lead us to conclude that the proper remedy is
declaratory relief. A declaration of unconstitutionality is a discretionary
remedy: <I>Operation Dismantle</I>, at p. 481, citing <I>Solosky v. The Queen</I>,
[1980] 1 S.C.R. 821. It has been recognized by this Court as &#147;an effective and
flexible remedy for the settlement of real disputes&#148;: <I>R. v. Gamble</I>,
[1988] 2 S.C.R. 595, at p. 649. A court can properly issue a declaratory remedy
so long as it has the jurisdiction over the issue at bar, the question before
the court is real and not theoretical, and the person raising it has a real
interest to raise it.&nbsp; Such is the case here.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt; ">[47]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">
</SPAN>The prudent course at this point, respectful of the
responsibilities of the executive and the courts, is for this Court to allow
Mr. Khadr&#146;s application for judicial review in part and to grant him a
declaration advising the government of its opinion on the records before it
which, in turn, will provide the legal framework for the executive to exercise
its functions and to consider what actions to take in respect of Mr. Khadr, in
conformity with the <I>Charter</I>.</P>

judicial review is allowed in part.&nbsp; This Court declares that through the
conduct of Canadian officials in the course of interrogations in 2003-2004, as
established on the evidence before us, Canada actively participated in a
process contrary to Canada&#146;s international human rights obligations and
contributed to Mr. Khadr&#146;s ongoing detention so as to deprive&nbsp; him of his&nbsp;
right to liberty and security of the person guaranteed by s. 7 of the <I>Charter</I>,
contrary to the principles of fundamental justice.&nbsp; Costs are awarded to Mr.
