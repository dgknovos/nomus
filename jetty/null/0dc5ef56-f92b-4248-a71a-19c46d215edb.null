<DIV class="Section4">

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">On September&nbsp;5, 2002, a computer technician arrived
unannounced at the accused&#146;s house to install a high&#8209;speed Internet
connection the accused had ordered.&nbsp; The accused lived with his wife and two
children, aged three and seven, but was alone that day with his younger
daughter.&nbsp; When the technician opened the accused&#146;s Web browser, he noticed
several links to both adult and child pornography sites in the taskbar&#146;s
&#147;favourites&#148; list, including two that were labelled &#147;Lolita Porn&#148; and &#147;Lolita
XXX&#148;.&nbsp; He also saw a legal pornographic image, but he could not remember
afterwards if it was on the browser&#146;s home page or on the computer desktop.&nbsp; In
the room, he noticed home videos and, on a tripod, a webcam that was connected
to a videotape recorder and was pointed at the toys and at the child.&nbsp; Unable
to finish his work on that day, the technician returned the following morning
and noted that everything had been &#147;cleaned up&#148;:&nbsp; the child&#146;s toys had been
placed in a box, the videotapes could no longer be seen, the webcam was pointed
at the computer user&#146;s chair and the computer hard drive had been &#147;formatted&#148;.&nbsp;
In November, concerned with the child&#146;s safety, the technician reported what he
had seen to a social worker, who contacted the RCMP.&nbsp; The technician made a
statement to Cst.&nbsp; O in January&nbsp;8, 2003.&nbsp; After the interview, O consulted
Cpl. B from the RCMP&#146;s Technological Crime Unit, who he knew had experience
investigating crimes involving computers and technological devices.&nbsp; B stated
that these types of offenders were habitual and would continue their computer
practices with child pornography and that this information would remain inside
the hard drive of the computer.&nbsp; O also spoke to Cst. H who, he had been told
by a Crown attorney, had experience investigating child exploitation offences.&nbsp;
H informed O&nbsp; that these offenders treasured collections on their computers and
liked to store them and create backups.&nbsp; O also verified whether an active
Internet connection was still being provided to the accused&#146;s residence.&nbsp; He
then drafted an information to obtain a search warrant (&#147;ITO&#148;) and, on January
10, a warrant was issued pursuant to s.&nbsp;487 of the <I>Criminal Code</I> to
search the accused&#146;s computer.&nbsp; Pornographic pictures involving children were
found on the computer and the accused was charged with possession of child
pornography contrary to s.&nbsp;163.1(4) of the <I>Criminal Code</I>.&nbsp; At
trial, he unsuccessfully challenged the validity of the search warrant under
s.&nbsp;8 of the <I>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</I>&nbsp; The trial
judge convicted the accused and the majority of the Court of Appeal upheld the
conviction.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;"><I>Held</I> (Deschamps, Charron

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;"><I>Per</I> McLachlin&nbsp;C.J.
and Binnie, Abella and <B>Fish</B>&nbsp;JJ.:&nbsp; The ITO is limited to allegations
of possession of child pornography contrary to s.&nbsp;163.1(4) of the <I>Criminal
Code</I> and does not involve allegations of accessing child pornography
pursuant to s.&nbsp;163.1(4.1).&nbsp; Merely viewing in a web browser an illegal
image stored in a remote location on the Internet does not establish the level
of control necessary to find possession.&nbsp; Neither does creating a &#147;favourite&#148;
or an &#147;icon&#148; on one&#146;s computer. In order to commit the offence of possession,
as opposed to the offence of accessing of child pornography, one must knowingly
acquire the underlying data files and store them in a place under one&#146;s
control.&nbsp; It is the underlying data file that is the stable &#147;object&#148; that can
be transferred, stored, and possessed.&nbsp; The automatic caching of a file to the
hard drive does not, without more, constitute possession.&nbsp; While the cached
file might be in a &#147;place&#148; over which the computer user has control, in order
to establish possession it must be shown that the file was knowingly stored and
retained through the cache.&nbsp;&nbsp; An ITO seeking a warrant to search for evidence
of possession, rather than accessing, must therefore provide reasonable grounds
to believe that the alleged offender possesses (or has possessed) digital files
of an illegal image, and that evidence of that possession will be found in the
place to be searched at the time the warrant is sought.&nbsp; Here, the search and
seizure of the accused&#146;s computer infringed his right under s.&nbsp;8 of the <I>Charter</I>.&nbsp;
Even when corrected and amplified on review, the ITO was insufficient to permit
any justice of the peace, acting reasonably, to find adequate grounds for the
search.&nbsp; The ITO did not allege the distinct and separate offence of accessing
child pornography and, stripped of its defects and deficiencies, all that
really remained were two Internet links, seen four months earlier in the
&#147;Favourites&#148; menu of a web browser on a computer that was subsequently
formatted, deleting both links. The prior presence of the two &#147;Lolita&#148; links
supports a reasonable inference that the accused browsed a website that
contained explicit images of females under the age of 18, but this does not
suffice to establish possession.</P>

<DIV class="Section7">

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">The misleading passages in the ITO that suggested that
the technician had actually viewed illegal pornography on the computer, rather
than suspiciously labelled &#147;favourites&#148;, must be excised. That pornographic
images of children were actually seen on the computer is an entirely false
claim. Aside from false statements, the ITO in several places gave an
incomplete and misleading account of the facts, in contravention of the
informant&#146;s duty to make full and frank disclosure of all material
information.&nbsp; The ITO does not mention, as the <I>voir dire</I> revealed, that
the two &#147;favorites&#148; were &#147;just scattered through the favourites&#148; among
additional links pointing to &#147;regular adult material&#148;.&nbsp; The failure to mention
these facts creates a misleading impression.&nbsp; Once it is understood that the
suspicious &#147;Favourites&#148; were in fact exceptions, found together with much more
material that was undisputedly legal, the inference that the accused possessed
illegal images becomes significantly less compelling.&nbsp; Furthermore, the
descriptions of the webcam and its placement are juxtaposed immediately
alongside the descriptions of the suspicious &#147;Favourites&#148; and the technician&#146;s
claims that he had &#147;observed &#145;Lolita Porn&#146;&#148;, clearly suggesting that the
accused might have been making (and possessing) his own illegal pornography.&nbsp;
The ITO, however, did not include a number of additional facts known to the
police.&nbsp; First, the three&#8209;year&#8209; old child mentioned, but not
identified, in the ITO was in fact the accused&#146;s daughter.&nbsp; Second, the ITO
stated that the accused was alone in the house with the girl, but failed to
mention that his wife lived with them.&nbsp; Third, the ITO also failed to mention
that the child was fully clothed, that there was no evidence of abuse, that the
computer room had a child gate and appeared to double as a playroom for the
child, and that the child was playing with the scattered toys in the middle of
the room when the technician arrived.&nbsp; While the reviewing judge found no
deliberate attempt to mislead, it is nonetheless evident that the police
officer&#146;s selective presentation of the facts painted a less objective and more
villainous picture than the picture that would have emerged had he disclosed
all the material information available to him at the time.&nbsp; It seems much more
plausible that the accused was simply using the VCR and webcam to videotape his
young daughter at play for posterity&#146;s sake, rather than for any purpose
connected to child pornography.</P>

</SPAN>

<DIV class="Section8">

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">To conclude that evidence of possession would be found
four months after the hard drive was erased, one must accept either that the
accused had made external copies of illegal images present in the computer
before formatting its hard drive or that he acquired additional illegal images
after the formatting.&nbsp; While the ITO seeks to establish inferences based on the
likely behaviour of the accused on the basis of generalizations made by B and H
about the propensities of certain &#147;types of offenders&#148; to hoard and copy
illegal images, the ITO does not establish either the veracity of the
generalization about the alleged &#147;type of offender&#148;, or that the accused is in
fact the &#147;type&#148; to which the generalization might have applied. The ITO
contains no evidentiary material in this regard apart from the bald assertion
of the two police officers and there is virtually nothing to describe, let
alone establish, the expertise of the officers.&nbsp; Moreover, the class of persons
to whom specific proclivities are attributed is defined so loosely as to bear
no real significance.&nbsp; There is no reason to believe, on the basis of the
information in the ITO as amplified, that all child pornography offenders
engage in hoarding, storing, sorting, and categorizing activity.&nbsp; To permit
reliance on broad generalizations about loosely defined classes of people is to
invite dependence on stereotypes and prejudices in lieu of evidence.&nbsp; It is not
the role of courts to establish by judicial fiat broad generalizations
regarding the &#147;proclivities&#148; of certain &#147;types&#148; of people, including
offenders.&nbsp; Matters of this sort are best left to be established by the Crown,
according to the relevant standard &#151; in this case, reasonable grounds for
belief.&nbsp; Here, two suspiciously labelled links in the &#147;Favourites&#148; do not
suffice to characterize a person as an habitual child pornography offender of
the type that seeks out and hoards illegal images.&nbsp; The fact that the bulk of
the pornographic material that the technician observed at the accused&#146;s house
was legal adult pornography suggests that the accused did not have a &#147;pronounced&#148;
interest in child pornography. </P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">The presence of the webcam, which was functioning as a
camcorder recording to a VCR, has only a tenuous relation to the crime
alleged.&nbsp; While it may be true that the accused was adept at recording
videotapes and storing the tapes for future use &#151; as is nearly everyone who
owns a camcorder &#151; this says nothing about his propensity to store a different
kind of image (child pornography), in a different medium (a computer, as
opposed to videotape), acquired in a different manner (downloading, as opposed
to filming).&nbsp; To draw an inference that he is of the type to hoard illegal
images is to speculate impermissibly.&nbsp; Nor does the accused&#146;s conduct after the
technician&#146;s visit support the conclusion that he was the sort of person to
seek out and hoard child pornography.&nbsp; The accused might well have tidied up
the room and formatted his computer simply to avoid further embarrassment from
having an outsider see the disorderly state of his home and the evidence of his
consumption of pornography on his computer.&nbsp; The accused&#146;s conduct might raise
suspicions but, as a matter of law, mere suspicion is no substitute for
reasonable grounds. </P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">The evidence obtained as a result of the illegal search
should be excluded under s.&nbsp;24(2) of the <I>Charter</I>.&nbsp; When the three
relevant factors are balanced,&nbsp; admitting the illegally obtained evidence in
this case would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.&nbsp; The trial
judge found no deliberate attempt to mislead and no deliberate misconduct on
the part of the officer who swore the ITO, but the repute of the administration
of justice would nonetheless be significantly eroded, particularly in the long
term, if criminal trials were permitted to proceed on the strength of evidence
obtained from the most private &#147;place&#148; in the home on the basis of misleading,
inaccurate, and incomplete ITOs upon which a search warrant was issued.&nbsp; The
public must have confidence that invasions of privacy are justified, in
advance, by a genuine showing of probable cause. </P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;"><I>Per</I> <B>Deschamps</B>,
Charron and Rothstein&nbsp;JJ. (dissenting):&nbsp; A specific intention to deal with
the object in a particular manner is not an element of the offence of
possession of child pornography.&nbsp; Sections&nbsp;4(3) and 163.1(4) of the <I>Criminal
Code</I> indicate that possession of child pornography is criminal in and of
itself, irrespective of the use to which the accused intends to put the
prohibited material. The requisite <I>mens rea</I> will be established at trial
if it is shown that the accused willingly took or maintained control of the
object with full knowledge of its character.&nbsp; The accused does not need to have
control in a place belonging to him or her, such as his or her hard drive.&nbsp; The
provision simply requires the material to be &#147;in any place&#148; for the use or
benefit of the accused.&nbsp; Therefore, even if an accused does not actually
download offending material, possession is established if the accused has
control over the material for his or her use or benefit or for that of someone
else.&nbsp; When applying for a search warrant, it is sufficient that there be
credible evidence to support a reasonable belief that the search will provide
evidence of commission of the offence.</P>

<DIV class="Section10">

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">Although the ITO could have been more elaborate in many
respects, the omissions the accused complains of do not support a conclusion
that the ITO was so deficient that it did not provide the authorizing judge
with a sufficiently credible factual basis.&nbsp; The information concerning the
presence of the child, the toys, and the webcam was necessary to convey to the
authorizing judge the technician&#146;s concerns about the safety of the child.&nbsp;
From this perspective, the facts that the accused was the child&#146;s father and
that he resided with his wife, which were not mentioned in the ITO, were not
determinative since, in the technician&#146;s mind, what was at stake was the safety
of a child.&nbsp; The references in the ITO to the removal of child pornography&nbsp;
from the accused&#146;s computer cannot be characterized as false.&nbsp; Viewed in
context, there is no question that what had, according to the technician, been
removed from the computer were the links in the &#147;favourites&#148; list to child
pornography.&nbsp; Therefore the authorizing judge must have understood this to be
the case.&nbsp; Since there is no indication that the allegations or references were
meant to mislead or were so lacking in informational context, they should not
be expunged from the ITO.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">&nbsp;It was neither inappropriate nor erroneous to rely on
the information provided by officers B and H about the propensity of child
pornography offenders to collect and hoard such materials.&nbsp; This propensity,
which seems to be notorious, has been accepted in numerous child pornography
cases as part of the factual backdrop giving rise to reasonable grounds for
issuing search warrants.&nbsp; While&nbsp; more contextual information on both the
subject matter and the source would have made it easier to understand and
assess the officers&#146; statements, there is no indication that they were not
qualified or that there was any intention to mislead.&nbsp; Consequently, it was
open to the reviewing judge to receive evidence which amplified the information
and conclude that the authorizing judge was provided with sufficient evidence.&nbsp;
The positions the officers held in their respective forces were&nbsp; also enough&nbsp;
to support a conclusion that their statements had sufficient probative value to
be included in the ITO.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, the officers did not state that the accused
was a habitual child pornography offender.&nbsp; The conversations between O and the
other officers took place several months after the technician&#146;s visits, and
they related to what material might be found in the computer and whether
material would still be found there despite the time elapsed between the visits
and the swearing of the ITO.&nbsp; These are facts that O had to put before the
authorizing judge. </P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">Although there was a four&#8209;month delay between the
technician&#146;s visits and the swearing of the ITO,&nbsp; it was reasonable for the
authorizing judge to conclude that the accused still had the computer in
question in his residence and that any &#147;child pornography&#148; was still in the
house.&nbsp; There was adequate information in the ITO about the storage of the
materials, and no reason to presume that the accused would have changed his
computer after the visits and no indication that the computer was in any way in
need of being replaced.&nbsp; It was therefore appropriate for O to rely on common
sense and on the ongoing subscription to an Internet connection to support his
allegation that the computer was still in the accused&#146;s residence.&nbsp; The police
officers&#146; statements concerning the proclivity of child pornography users to
save and collect such material could also serve as a basis for concluding that
it was reasonable to believe that, if the accused was this type of offender,
evidence of the offence would still be found in the computer after four months.

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">In this case, the facts alleged in the ITO, as amplified
at the <I>voir dire</I>, were sufficient for the reviewing judge to conclude
that there was a basis for the authorizing judge&#146;s decision to issue the
warrant.&nbsp; The facts that there were several links to both adult and child
pornography in the &#147;favourites&#148; list and that a &#147;graphic&#148; pornographic image
was prominently displayed on the computer justified the authorizing judge&#146;s
drawing the reasonable inference that the accused had a conspicuous interest in
this type of material.&nbsp; The position of the camera and the fact that it was
connected to a videotape recorder at the time of the technician&#146;s first visit,
together with the presence of both labelled and unlabelled videotapes, showed
that he was interested in reproducing images, accumulating such material, and
keeping it for his future use.&nbsp; The accused&#146;s desire not to arouse suspicion
with respect to his reproduction of images or his computer practices could
reasonably be inferred from his actions after being informed that the
technician needed to return.&nbsp; There was a credibly based probability that the
accused was in the habit of reproducing and saving images and had a propensity
to pornography, and more specifically to child pornography.&nbsp; While the police
officers&#146; statements could not be used to demonstrate that he was a type of
person who was likely to be in possession of child pornography, given that
there is credible independent evidence of this, they do shed light on the
implications of that evidence.&nbsp; In these circumstances, the statements that
child pornography offenders are collectors could only make it more likely that
evidence of the possession of prohibited material would still exist at the time
the ITO was drafted.</P>

</SPAN>To be sure, offences involving child pornography are particularly
insidious. They breed a demand for images that exploit vulnerable children,
both economically and morally.&nbsp; Understandably, offences of this sort evoke a

</SPAN>It is for this very reason that the police, in enforcing the law, must
avoid any temptation to resort to stereotypical, inflammatory, or misleading
allegations.&nbsp; And where they yield to that temptation, courts must be
particularly vigilant to issue process, or subsequently validate the issuance
of process, only where reasonable and probable grounds for a search or an
arrest are in fact made out.&nbsp; While the law must be relentlessly enforced,
legal requirements must be respected, and constitutional safeguards preserved.&nbsp;

</SPAN>Unlike Justice Deschamps and with the greatest of respect, I am
satisfied that the record discloses no reasonable and probable grounds for the
search and seizure of the appellant&#146;s computer.&nbsp; I agree with Richards J.A.,
dissenting in the Court of Appeal, that the search and seizure therefore
infringed the appellant&#146;s constitutional right, under s. 8 of the <I>Canadian

to exclude the evidence thus obtained.&nbsp; In the absence of this illegally
obtained evidence, the appellant could not reasonably have been convicted.&nbsp;

</SPAN>On an allegation of <I>personal possession</I>, the requirement of
knowledge comprises two elements: the accused must be aware that he or she has
physical custody of the thing in question, and must be aware as well of what
that thing is. Both elements must co-exist with an act of control (outside of
public duty): <I>Beaver v. The Queen</I>, [1957] S.C.R. 531, at pp. 541-42.&nbsp; </P>

</SPAN><I>Constructive</I> possession is established where the accused did not

place belongs to or is occupied by him, for the use or benefit of himself or of
another person.&#148;&nbsp; (<I>Criminal Code</I>, s. 4(3)(<I>a</I>)).&nbsp; Constructive
possession is thus complete where the accused:&nbsp; (1) has&nbsp; knowledge of the
character of the object, (2) knowingly puts or keeps the object in a particular
place, whether or not that place belongs to him, and (3) intends to have the
object in the particular place for his &#147;use or benefit&#148; or that of another

</SPAN>Here, the appellant is alleged to have had possession of digital images
in a computer, rather than tangible objects.&nbsp; The law of possession, however,
developed in relation to physical, concrete objects.&nbsp; Its extension to virtual
objects &#151; in this case, images stored as digital files and displayed on
computer monitors &#151; presents conceptual problems.&nbsp; Unlike traditional
photographs, the digital information encoding the image &#151; the image file &#151; can
be possessed even if no representation of the image is visible.&nbsp; Likewise, even
if displayed on a person&#146;s computer monitor, the underlying information might
remain firmly outside that person&#146;s possession, located on a server thousands

</SPAN>Essentially, there are thus two potential &#147;objects&#148; of possession of an
image&nbsp; in a computer &#151; the image file and its decoded visual representation
on-screen.&nbsp; The question is whether one can ever be said to be in culpable
possession of the visual depiction alone, or whether one can only culpably
possess the underlying file.&nbsp; Canadian cases appear implicitly to accept only
the latter proposition: That possession of an image&nbsp; in a computer means <I>possession
of the underlying data file</I>, not its mere visual depiction.</P>

</SPAN>This is a sensible interpretation for a number of reasons.&nbsp; First, and
most important, because Parliament, in s. 163.1(4.1) of the <I>Criminal Code</I>,
has made accessing illegal child pornography a separate crime, different from
possession.&nbsp; In virtue of s.&nbsp;163.1(4.2), a person accesses child
pornography by &#147;knowingly caus[ing the] child pornography to be viewed by, or
transmitted to, himself or herself&#148;.&nbsp; </P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm; ">[26]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
</SPAN>Parliament&#146;s purpose in creating the offence of accessing child
pornography, as explained by the then Minister of Justice, was to &#147;capture
those who intentionally view child pornography on the [Inter]net but where the
legal notion of possession may be problematic&#148; (Hon. Anne McLellan, <I>House of
Commons Debates</I>, vol. 137, 1st Sess., 37th Parl., May 3, 2001, at p. 3581).</P>

</SPAN>What made a charge of possession &#147;problematic&#148;, of course, is that
possessing a digital file and viewing it are discrete operations &#151; one could be
criminalized without also criminalizing the other.&nbsp; In the case of child
pornography, Parliament has now criminalized both.&nbsp; But viewing and possession should
nevertheless be kept conceptually separate, lest the criminal law be left
without the analytical tools necessary to distinguish between storing the
underlying data file and merely viewing the representation that is produced
when that data, residing elsewhere, is decoded.&nbsp; The ITO here is specifically
limited to allegations of possession pursuant to s. 163.1(4) of the <I>Criminal
Code</I> (ITO, preamble and paras. 2, 4 and 16). </P>

</SPAN>Interpreting possession to apply only to the underlying data file is
also more faithful to a traditional understanding of what it means to &#147;possess&#148;
something.&nbsp; The traditional objects of criminal possession &#151; for example,
contraband, drugs, and illegal weapons &#151; are all things that could, potentially
at least, be transferred to another person.&nbsp; </P>

</SPAN>Without storing the underlying data, however, an image on a screen
cannot be transferred.&nbsp; The mere possibility of sharing a <I>link </I>to a
Website or enlarging the visual depiction of a Website, as one could &#147;zoom in&#148;
on&nbsp; a TV screen image, is insufficient to constitute control over the content
of that site.&nbsp; It is indeed the underlying data file that is the stable
&#147;object&#148; that can be transferred, stored, and, indeed, possessed.&nbsp; More
broadly, the object possessed must itself have some sort of permanence.&nbsp; </P>

</SPAN>Thus, while it does not matter for the purposes of criminal possession
how briefly one is in possession of the object, the thing said to be culpably
possessed cannot &#151; like a broadcast image flickering across a TV screen or a
digital image displayed transiently on-screen &#151; be essentially evanescent.</P>

</SPAN>Plainly, the mere fact that an image has been accessed by or displayed
in a Web browser does not, without more, constitute possession of that image.&nbsp;
An ITO seeking a warrant to search for evidence of possession (rather than
accessing) must therefore provide reasonable and probable grounds to believe
that the alleged offender possesses (or&nbsp; has possessed) digital files of an
illegal image, and that evidence of that possession will be found in the place
to be searched.&nbsp; It is not enough to provide reasonable and probable grounds to
believe that the alleged offender viewed or accessed illegal images using a computer,
without knowingly taking possession &#151; which includes control &#151; of the
underlying files in some way. </P>

</SPAN>In applying these principles to the facts of this case, I take care not
to be understood to have circumscribed or defined constructive possession of
virtual objects.&nbsp; I leave open the possibility, for example, that one could
constructively possess a digital file without downloading it to his or her hard
drive, using for example a Web&#8209;based e&#8209;mail account to store
illegal material.</P>

</SPAN>In short, my purpose here is not to say what constructive possession of
virtual objects <I>necessarily is</I>, but rather what it <I>manifestly is not</I>.&nbsp;
Plainly, in my view, previous access and the possibility of again accessing a
Website that contains digital images, located on a distant server over which
the viewer has no control, do not constitute &#151;&nbsp; either alone or together &#151;
constructive possession.&nbsp; However elastic the notion of constructive possession
may be, to stretch it that far is to defy the limits of its elasticity. </P>

location of the temporary, automatic copies is known as the &#147;cache&#148;.&nbsp; While the
configuration of the caching function varies and can be modified by the user,
cached files typically include images and are generally discarded automatically

</SPAN>On my view of possession, the automatic caching of a file to the hard
drive does not, without more, constitute possession.&nbsp; While the cached file
might be in a&nbsp; &#147;place&#148; over which the computer user has control, in order to
establish possession, it is necessary to satisfy <I>mens rea </I>or fault
requirements as well.&nbsp; Thus, it must be shown that the file was <I>knowingly </I>stored

</SPAN>In the present case, the charge is not based on the appellant using his
cache to possess child pornography.&nbsp; It is hardly surprising as most computer
users are unaware of the contents of their cache, how it operates, or even its
existence.&nbsp; Absent that awareness, they lack the mental or fault element
essential to a finding that they culpably possess the images in their cache.&nbsp;
Having said that, there may be rare cases where the cache is <I>knowingly </I>used
as a location to store copies of image files with the <I>intent </I>to retain
possession of them through the cache.&nbsp; </P>

possession, under which simply viewing an image might, in some circumstances at
least, constitute possession.&nbsp; As I will presently explain, even if one were to

probable grounds and had demonstrated investigative necessity but had, in good
faith made&#148; such errors (para 59).&nbsp; In all cases, the focus is on &#147;the
information available to the police at the time of the application&#148; rather than
information that the police acquired after the original application was made
(para. 59).</P>

</SPAN>The deficiencies of the ITO in this case must be addressed in some
detail before determining whether it could support the issuance of the
warrant.&nbsp; In particular, there are erroneous statements that must be excised,
and there are numerous omissions that violate &#147;[t]he legal obligation on anyone
seeking an <I>ex parte</I> authorization [to make] <I>full and frank</I>
disclosure of <I>material facts</I>&#148; (<I>Araujo</I>, at para. 46 (emphasis in
original)).&nbsp; Once these flaws are taken into account, it becomes clear that the
ITO, as reduced and amplified, could not possibly have afforded reasonable and
probable grounds to believe that the accused possessed child pornography and
that evidence of that crime would be found on his computer at the time the
warrant was sought or<I> at any time</I>.</P>

</SPAN>First, it is necessary to excise several misleading passages in the ITO
that suggested Mr. Hounjet had actually viewed illegal pornography on the
computer, rather than suspiciously-labelled bookmarks (&#147;Favourites&#148;).&nbsp; In
particular, para. 5 of the ITO, the first to adduce specific facts in support
of the application, contains two glaring and misleading inaccuracies.&nbsp; It
states, first, that &#147;[o]nce on the computer HOUNJET observed &#145;Lolita Porn&#146; on
the screen&#148;, and then that Mr. Hounjet &#147;returned the next day to find the porn
removed&#148;.&nbsp; </P>

</SPAN>The clear implication of these assertions is that Mr. Hounjet in fact
saw &#147;Lolita porn&#148; (pornography involving young girls) on the screen and that he
determined that this pornography was subsequently removed from the computer.&nbsp;
But Mr. Hounjet saw nothing of the sort.&nbsp; As is clear from the <I>voir dire</I>,
all he saw were two links labelled &#147;Lolita Porn&#148; and &#147;Lolita XXX&#148; in the
&#147;Favourites&#148; menu of the Internet browser.&nbsp; &#147;Favourites&#148; or bookmarks are
nothing more than &#147;menu entries&#148; that serve as shortcuts that provide easy
access to an Internet site.</P>

</SPAN>Justice Deschamps finds (at para. 155) that &#147;[t]here could be no
confusion about what was seen&#148;.&nbsp; I respectfully disagree.&nbsp; Nowhere does the ITO
disclaim the clear statement in para. 5 that Mr. Hounjet saw &#147;Lolita Porn&#148; and
that &#147;the porn&#148; was subsequently removed.&nbsp; While para. 10 does specify that Mr.
Hounjet saw &#147;Lolita Porn&#148; and &#147;Lolita XXX&#148; <I>icons</I>, the last sentence of
that very paragraph perpetuates the impression that <I>actual</I> child
pornography (rather than links) were seen: It asserts that when Mr. Hounjet
arrived the next day &#147;all the child porn off the computer was gone&#148;.&nbsp; </P>

</SPAN>There is no reasonable basis for assuming that the justice of the peace
would have understood these clear and misleading statements to refer
exclusively to the icons mentioned in para. 10.&nbsp; The natural reading of the ITO

</SPAN>For example, the <I>voir dire</I> revealed that the two bookmarks
described in the ITO &#151; the bookmarks labelled &#147;Lolita Porn&#148; and &#147;Lolita XXX&#148; &#151;
were &#147;just scattered through the favourites&#148; among additional links pointing to
&#147;regular adult material&#148; (Testimony of Adrian Hounjet at the <I>voir dire</I>,

</SPAN>Moreover, the only pornographic image that Mr. Hounjet actually did see
&#151; an image on the accused&#146;s computer desktop or Internet homepage &#151; was
perfectly legal adult pornography.&nbsp; The failure to mention these facts creates
a misleading impression that the accused was particularly inclined towards
child pornography or exclusively seeking it out.&nbsp; </P>

fact anomalies or exceptions, found together with much more material that was

pointing towards [children&#146;s] toys&#148;, and noted also that &#147;[t]he client was
alone in the house&nbsp; with a three year old child&#148; (ITO, at para. 5).&nbsp; Indeed,
these statements appear in the very first substantive paragraph of the ITO.&nbsp;
Later in the ITO, one learns that the webcam was not hooked up to the computer
but was rather plugged into a VCR that recorded to videotape (at para. 10).&nbsp; </P>

</SPAN>The descriptions of the webcam and its placement are juxtaposed
immediately alongside the descriptions of the suspicious &#147;Favourites&#148; and the
claims that Mr. Hounjet had &#147;observed &#145;Lolita Porn&#146;&#148;. &nbsp;The ITO thus invited the
justice of the peace to make an unwarranted connection between the two &#147;Lolita&#148;
bookmarks and the webcam trained at the children&#146;s play area.&nbsp; Read as a whole,
the ITO could thus be understood to allege that the accused had made and
possessed his own illegal pornography, in addition to possessing images from
the Internet on his computer.</P>

</SPAN>First, the three-year old child mentioned (but not identified) in the
ITO was in fact the accused&#146;s daughter.&nbsp; Second, the ITO stated that the
accused was alone in the house with the girl, but failed to mention that his
wife lived with them.&nbsp; Third, the ITO failed to mention that the child was
fully clothed, that there was no evidence of abuse, that the computer room had
a child gate and appeared to double as a playroom for the child, and that the
child was playing with the scattered toys in the middle of the room when Mr.
Hounjet arrived, before being taken out of the room by the accused (A.R. at pp.

</SPAN>These omitted facts all tend to undermine suspicions about the accused.&nbsp;
Once they are added to the picture, it seems much more plausible that the

pornography.&nbsp; </P>

</SPAN>In failing to provide these details, the informant failed to respect his

careful not to &#147;pick and choose&#148; among the relevant facts in order to achieve
the desired outcome. The informant&#146;s obligation is to present <I>all</I> <I>material
facts, favourable or not</I>.&nbsp; Concision, a laudable objective, may be achieved
by omitting irrelevant or insignificant details, but not by material
non-disclosure.&nbsp; This means that an attesting officer must avoid incomplete
recitations of known facts, taking care not to invite an inference that would
not be drawn or a conclusion that would not be reached if the omitted facts
were disclosed. </P>

</SPAN>The relevant question here is whether the ITO was misleading, not
whether it was <I>intentionally</I> misleading.&nbsp; Indeed, in the Court of
Queen&#146;s Bench, the judge who had the benefit of observing the Crown&#146;s witnesses
on the <I>voir dire</I> found no deliberate attempt to mislead.&nbsp; That
conclusion should not be disturbed.&nbsp; It is nonetheless evident that the police

</SPAN>The facts originally omitted must be considered on a review of the
sufficiency of the warrant application.&nbsp; In <I>Araujo</I>, the Court held that
where the police make good faith errors in the drafting of an ITO, the warrant
authorization should be reviewed in light of amplification evidence adduced at
the <I>voir dire</I> to correct those mistakes.&nbsp; Likewise, where, as in this
case, the police fail to discharge their duty to fully and frankly disclose
material facts, evidence adduced at the <I>voir dire</I> should be used to fill

</SPAN>The admissibility of the evidence obtained pursuant to the search and
seizure of the appellant&#146;s computer depends on two constitutional
considerations.&nbsp; The first is whether the search and seizure were unreasonable,
within the meaning of s. 8 of the <I>Charter</I>; the second is whether
admission of the evidence thereby obtained would bring the administration of
justice into disrepute, and should therefore be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2). </P>

</SPAN>The second question is only reached, of course, if the first is resolved
in the appellant&#146;s favour.&nbsp; And that depends on whether the ITO, stripped of
its erroneous and tendentious assertions, and amplified as indicated, provides
sufficient credible and reliable evidence to have permitted the justice of the
peace to find reasonable and probable grounds to believe both that the
appellant was in culpable possession of child pornography and that evidence of
that crime would be found in his computer. </P>

</SPAN>Essentially, only two inferential paths could have led the justice to
conclude that the warrant should issue: (1) the two suspicious bookmarks; (2)
the claims about the propensity of certain &#147;types of offenders&#148; to hoard
images, combined with reason to believe that the accused is of that &#147;type&#148;.&nbsp; In
my view, both paths lead instead to an evidentiary dead end: they culminate in
suspicion and conjecture, never reaching the mandatory threshold of reasonable
and probable grounds to believe.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm; ">[64]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
</SPAN>The presence of the two &#147;Lolita&#148; links in the Favourites certainly
supports a reasonable inference that the accused browsed a Website that
contained explicit images of females under the age of 18.&nbsp; And it is not
unreasonable to infer from the mere presence of the links on the appellant&#146;s
computer, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that they were knowingly
added by him.</P>

</SPAN>This does not suffice, however, to establish possession.&nbsp; First, as
earlier explained, merely browsing a website or viewing images onscreen does
not constitute&nbsp; possession.&nbsp; Neither does creating a bookmark on one&#146;s computer
establish possession over the content of the Website: bookmarks merely provide
quick and easy <I>access</I> to&nbsp; the indicated Websites.&nbsp; Indeed, clicking on a
bookmark may simply disclose that material previously on the Website has been
removed; that material previously absent has been added; that the Website
address is no longer valid &#151; or that the Website no longer exists at all.&nbsp; </P>

</SPAN>Accordingly, in order to commit the offence of possession (as opposed to
the offence of accessing), one must <I>knowingly acquire the underlying data
files and store them in a place under one&#146;s control</I>.&nbsp; The presence of the
icons might arouse suspicions regarding possession, but it does not alone
support a reasonable inference that the appellant not only accessed the website
and knowingly viewed illegal images located there, but also took the underlying
data file into his control by saving it to the hard drive, or otherwise.</P>

</SPAN>Even if one takes the broader view that possession is complete on merely
viewing images on-screen, other facts in the ITO preclude the possibility of

appellant&#146;s computer.&nbsp; </P>

</SPAN>Specifically, the ITO states that on the day after the icons were
viewed, the computer&#146;s hard drive was &#147;formatted&#148;.&nbsp; On the <I>voir dire</I>, it
was confirmed that this meant that the entire contents of the hard drive were
deleted.&nbsp; Not only would the suspicious links have thus been erased, but
illegal image files in the computer and any files evidencing past access to
Websites containing illegal images (such as browser histories or cache files)
would also have been removed.&nbsp; Normally, moreover, the greater the lapse of
time after a hard drive has been formatted, the more likely it will be
impossible to recover the former contents of the drive using forensic tools.&nbsp;
In this case, four months had passed.&nbsp; And, in any event, the nature of
&#147;formatting&#148; and data retention on computer drives was not sufficiently
described in the ITO to permit issuance of the warrant on these grounds.</P>

</SPAN>&nbsp;To conclude that evidence of possession would be found four months

</SPAN>Both possibilities require drawing inferences based on the likely
behaviour of the accused.&nbsp; The ITO seeks to establish the necessary inference
on the basis of unsupported generalizations about the propensities of certain
&#147;types of offenders&#148; to hoard and copy illegal images.&nbsp; The ITO suggests that
the accused is a person of that &#147;type&#148; and that, as a result, copies of the
images would remain on the computer.&nbsp; </P>

of offenders.&nbsp; It first states that &#147;these type[s] of offenders are habitual
and will continue their computer practices with child pornography&#148; (ITO, at
para. 12).&nbsp; This claim is attributed to Corporal Boyce of the RCMP
Technological Crime Unit.&nbsp; The ITO also claims that &#147;offenders treasure
collections on their computer and like to store them and create backup&#146;s (<I>sic</I>)
in case they loose (<I>sic</I>) it.&nbsp; Discs and floppy disks are used for this
purpose.&nbsp; Offenders will typically sort information and store pictures on
different file names to catagorize (<I>sic</I>) them.&#148; (ITO, at para. 13).&nbsp;

</SPAN>The main difficulty with these generalizations about certain &#147;types of

the bald assertion of the two police officers.&nbsp; Furthermore, there is virtually
nothing to describe, let alone establish, the expertise of the officers to whom

in the officers&#146; names, positions, and places of work.&nbsp; This is surely an insufficient

in light of <I>Araujo</I>, could be corrected with evidence adduced at the <I>voir

the officer who prepared the ITO, believed Cst. Huisman to be an expert in
crimes involving child pornography only on the basis of a recommendation from a
prosecutor, his own impressions from talking to Cst. Huisman, and his
understanding that Cst. Huisman had previously worked on unspecified &#147;child

expert on <I>computer technology</I>, not the habits of child pornography
offenders.&nbsp; While Cst. Ochitwa was aware that Cpl. Boyce worked in the
Technological Crimes Unit and knew what his duties were there &#151; investigating
crimes involving computers &#151; there is no indication at all whether or how his
work in that unit formed the basis for his opinions about child pornography
offenders (Testimony of Cst. Ochitwa, A.R., at pp. 157-58 and 191-92).</P>

</SPAN>Perhaps even more troubling than the paucity of information as to the
basis for the officers&#146; opinions is the fact that the class of persons to whom
specific proclivities are attributed is defined so loosely as to bear no real
significance.&nbsp; Both officers speak about the propensities of undefined &#147;types

</SPAN>While it is clear from the context that the officers are referring to
some variety of child pornography offenders, it cannot be assumed, without
evidence, that broad but meaningful generalizations can be made about all
persons who commit (or are suspected of committing) child pornography
offences.&nbsp; For example, a person with an exclusive interest in child
pornography is surely of a different &#147;type&#148; than a person who is primarily or
exclusively interested in legal adult images, but has nevertheless downloaded a
small number of illegal images.&nbsp; Similarly, a person who seeks out pornographic
images of young children or infants is likely a different &#147;type&#148; than a person
who views images of teenagers under the age of 18.&nbsp; </P>

</SPAN>These people all commit child pornography offences, but the
&#147;propensities&#148; of one type may well differ widely from the &#147;propensities&#148; of
others.&nbsp; There is no reason to believe, on the basis of the information in the
ITO, that <I>all</I> child pornography offenders engage in hoarding, storing,
sorting, and categorizing activity.&nbsp; And there is nothing in the ITO that
indicates which specific subset of these offenders does generally engage in

</SPAN>To permit reliance on broad generalizations about loosely&#8209;defined
classes of people is to invite dependence on stereotypes and prejudices in lieu
of evidence.&nbsp; I am thus unable to agree with Justice Deschamps (at para. 162)
that the ITO&#146;s claims in this regard could properly be relied on by the
justice.</P>

</SPAN>Justice Deschamps supports her reliance on claims about the behaviour of
&#147;types of offenders&#148; by citing child pornography cases in which courts, in her
view, have accepted the tendency of certain kinds of child pornography
offenders to collect many images and store them over long periods of time
(para. 162).&nbsp; These decisions are rather in favour of&nbsp; the conclusion that an
evidentiary basis is required to support a finding as to the characteristics or
propensities of child pornography offenders.&nbsp; </P>

</SPAN>That some child pornography offenders do seek out and hoard illegal
images is, of course, neither surprising nor helpful in determining whether
reasonable and probable grounds exist in a particular case.&nbsp; Still, it is not
the role of courts to establish by judicial fiat broad generalizations
regarding the &#147;proclivities&#148; of certain &#147;types&#148; of people, including
offenders.&nbsp; Matters of this sort are best left to be established by the Crown,
according to the relevant standard &#151; in this case, reasonable and probable
grounds for belief.&nbsp; As suggested earlier, moreover, courts must be
particularly wary of endorsing such generalizations when, as in this case, the
crime alleged is the subject of intense emotional responses and widespread
condemnation, and the temptation to rely on stereotype rather that evidence is
therefore especially dangerous and strong.</P>

</SPAN>An evidentiary basis is required as well for a finding of reasonable and

child pornography offenders whose characteristics or propensities are mentioned
in the ITO.&nbsp; This view of the law was adopted in <I>R. v. Fawthrop</I>, (2002),

Deschamps.&nbsp; My colleague finds in that decision support for her suggestion that
general opinions on the propensity of child pornography offenders to collect
and hoard child pornography material can give rise to reasonable and probable grounds
for issuing search warrants.&nbsp; With respect, I read <I>Fawthrop</I>

<DIV class="Section39">

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify">In my view,
the trial judge&#146;s finding, based on the testimony of Det. Const. Pulkki, that
the police were engaged in a &#147;fishing expedition&#148; for items of child
pornography leads to the conclusion that the breach of the appellant&#146;s s. 8 <I>Charter
</I>rights was serious. It appears from the record that after she interviewed
A.Y. and members of her family, Det. Const. Pulkki suspected that the appellant
was a pedophile, which led her to further suspect that he might possess items
of child pornography. To be fair to her, she realized that her suspicion was
insufficient to enable her to obtain a warrant. She was aware that it was
necessary that she have reasonable grounds to believe that child pornography
would be located in the appellant&#146;s home. She sought the opinion of Dr. Collins
in the hope that it would tip the scales from suspicion to reasonable grounds.
As the trial judge recognized, the opinion of Dr. Collins failed to do so. He
recognized the fatal flaw in the opinion. Although Dr. Collins opined that it
was not uncommon for pedophiles to collect items of child pornography, he was
unable to form an opinion as to whether the appellant was a pedophile. Without
that link, Det. Const. Pulkki was in the same position as she had been before
she contacted Dr. Collins. All she had was a suspicion that the appellant might
be in possession of child pornography. ... This resulted in an unauthorized
search for those items by means of what the trial judge correctly labelled a
&#147;fishing expedition&#148;. This is what the search warrant process is meant to
prevent.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">In the result,
the evidence seized under the warrant was excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) of the <I>Charter</I>.</P>

</SPAN>In short, in most of the cases cited by my colleague, the original
warrant application included relatively detailed descriptions of the habits of
a specific class of child pornography offender.&nbsp; They thus provided evidence
sufficient to establish a credible profile of a class of child pornography
collectors and their typical behaviours, and a proper factual foundation for
concluding that the alleged offender belonged to that class.&nbsp; This is not our
case.</P>

</SPAN>Here, even if the impugned generalizations are accepted, the ITO as
amplified does not reasonably permit the inference that the accused was the
&#147;type of offender&#148; who sought out illegal pornography and stored it.&nbsp; This
requirement was well explained in&nbsp; <I>United States v. Weber</I>, 923 F.2d 1338
(9th Cir. 1990)), at p. 1345: &#147;[I]f the government presents expert opinion
about the behavior of a particular class of persons, for the opinion to have
any relevance, the affidavit must lay a foundation which shows that the person
subject to the search is a member of the class&#148;.&nbsp; </P>

</SPAN>Two suspiciously&#8209;labelled links in the &#147;Favourites&#148; menu do not
suffice to characterize a person as an habitual child pornography offender of
the type that seeks out and hoards illegal images.&nbsp; Indeed, the fact that the
bulk of the pornographic material that Mr. Hounjet observed at the accused&#146;s
house was perfectly legal adult pornography suggests that the accused did not
have a &#147;pronounced&#148; interest in child pornography at all, contrary to my
colleague&#146;s assertion (paras. 177 and 179).</P>

</SPAN>Also, and again with respect, the cases my colleague relies on (at para.
173) do not support the notion that a warrant can be issued months after a
person might have merely viewed child pornography.&nbsp; For example, in <I>United
States v. Terry</I>, 522 F.3d 645 (6th Cir. 2008), the warrant was issued on a
probable cause finding that the accused <I>had in fact saved child pornography
on his computer five months earlier</I>.&nbsp; Also, the Prince Edward Island Court
of Appeal in <I>R. v. Graham</I>, 2008 PESCAD 7, 277 Nfld. &amp; P.E.I.R. 103,

&#147;showed that [the accused] was interested in reproducing images, accumulating
such material, and keeping it for his future use&#148;, showed that the accused &#147;was
in the habit of reproducing and saving images and had a propensity to
pornography and more specifically to child pornography&#148; (para. 179).&nbsp; With

</SPAN>While it may be true that the accused was adept at recording videotapes
and storing the tapes for future use &#151; as is nearly everyone who owns a
camcorder &#151; this says absolutely nothing about his propensity to store a

is to speculate impermissibly.&nbsp; At its highest, the proposed inference might

not to arouse suspicion with respect to his reproduction of images or his
computer practices&#148; and that the conduct created &#147;a credibly based probability

consumption of pornography on his computer.&nbsp; Again, the accused&#146;s conduct might

interests of the accused (admission may send the message that individual rights
count for little), and (3) society&#146;s interest in the adjudication of the case
on its merits.&nbsp; The court&#146;s role on a s. 24(2) application is to balance the
assessments under each of these lines of inquiry to determine whether,
considering all the circumstances, admission of the evidence would bring the
administration of justice into disrepute.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">I shall consider
these three factors in turn.</P>

</SPAN>First, the <I>Charter</I>&#8209;infringing state conduct in this case
was the search of the accused&#146;s home and the seizure of his personal computer,
his wife&#146;s laptop computer, several videotapes, and other items.&nbsp; The search
and seizure were unwarranted, but not warrantless: they were conducted pursuant
to a search warrant by officers who believed they were acting under lawful
authority.&nbsp; The executing officers did not wilfully or even negligently breach
the <I>Charter</I>.&nbsp; These considerations favour admission of the evidence. To
that extent, the search and seizure cannot be characterized as particularly
egregious.&nbsp; </P>

</SPAN>The opposite is true on considering the ITO upon which the warrant was
obtained.&nbsp; The officer who <I>prepared </I>the ITO was neither reasonably
diligent nor mindful of&nbsp; his duty to make full and frank disclosure.&nbsp; At best,
the ITO was improvidently and carelessly drafted.&nbsp; Not only did the ITO fail to
specify the correct offence (assessing rather than possession of child
pornography); it was also drafted in a misleading way, resulting in the
issuance of a warrant on insufficient grounds.&nbsp; While the trial judge found no
deliberate attempt to mislead, no attesting officer, acting reasonably, could
have failed to appreciate that repeated references to &#147;&#145;Lolita Porn&#146; on the
screen&#148; and to the deletion of &#147;all the child porn off the computer&#148; would
cause most readers &#151; and, more particularly, the issuing justice &#151; to believe
there was evidence that child pornography was actually viewed on-screen by the
witness Hounjet.&nbsp; </P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm; ">[101]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</SPAN>Similarly, the officer should have known &#151; if he in fact did not &#151; that
the immediate juxtaposition of these misleading statements and the incomplete
description of the &#147;web-cam pointing towards toys&#148; would be unjustifiably
inflammatory.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm; ">[102]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</SPAN>The repute of the administration of justice is jeopardized by judicial
indifference to unacceptable police conduct.&nbsp; Police officers seeking search
warrants are bound to act with diligence and integrity, taking care to
discharge the special duties of candour and full disclosure that attach in <I>ex
parte</I> proceedings.&nbsp; In discharging those duties responsibly, they must
guard against making statements that are likely to mislead the justice of the
peace.&nbsp; They must refrain from concealing or omitting relevant facts. And they
must take care not to otherwise exaggerate the information upon which they rely
to establish reasonable and probable grounds for issuance of a search warrant. </P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm; ">[103]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</SPAN>We are bound to accept the trial judge&#146;s finding that there was no
deliberate&nbsp; misconduct on the part of the officer who swore the Information.&nbsp;
The repute of the administration of justice would nonetheless be significantly
eroded, particularly in the long term, if such unacceptable police conduct were
permitted to form the basis for so intrusive an invasion of privacy as the
search of our homes and the seizure and scrutiny of our&nbsp; personal computers.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm; ">[104]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</SPAN>I turn in that light to the second factor set out in <I>Grant</I>: The
impact of the breach on the <I>Charter</I>-protected interests of the accused.&nbsp;
The intrusiveness of the search is of particular importance in this regard.&nbsp;
Our concern here is with the search of the appellant&#146;s home, in itself a
serious breach of the appellant&#146;s rights under s. 8 of the <I>Charter</I>.&nbsp; But
there is more.&nbsp; The infringement in this case involved a search of the
appellant&#146;s personal computer &#151; and his wife&#146;s laptop computer as well.&nbsp; In
passing, I&nbsp; recall here the Informant&#146;s failure to mention that the appellant
lived with his wife.&nbsp; This not only cast a dark light in the appellant&#146;s presence
alone with their child &#151; perfectly understandable in the circumstances &#151; but
may also explain why the laptop, which was in fact not his, was seized and
presumably scrutinized as well.&nbsp; </P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm; ">[105]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</SPAN>As I mentioned at the outset, it is difficult to imagine a more intrusive
invasion of privacy than the search of one&#146;s home and personal computer.&nbsp;
Computers often contain our most intimate correspondence.&nbsp; They contain the
details of our financial, medical, and personal situations.&nbsp; They even reveal
our specific interests, likes, and propensities, recording in the browsing
history and cache files the information we seek out and read, watch, or listen
to on the Internet.&nbsp; </P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm; ">[106]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</SPAN>It is therefore difficult to conceive a s.&nbsp;8 breach with a greater
impact on the <I>Charter</I>-protected privacy interests of the accused than
occurred in this case. </P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm; ">[107]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</SPAN>I turn, finally, to the third factor to be weighed under s. 24(2) of the
<I>Charter</I> &#151; society&#146;s interest in adjudication of the case on its merits.&nbsp;
Here, exclusion of the evidence obtained in the search would leave the
prosecution with essentially no case against the accused.&nbsp; It would thus
seriously undermine the truth-seeking function of the trial, a factor that
weighs against exclusion (<I>Grant</I>, at paras. 79-83).&nbsp; </P>

</SPAN>In balancing these considerations, we are required by <I>Grant</I> to
bear in mind the long-term and prospective repute of the administration of
justice, focussing less on the particular case than on the impact over time of
admitting the evidence obtained by infringement of the constitutionally
protected rights of the accused. </P>

</SPAN>In my view, the repute of the administration of justice will be
significantly undermined if criminal trials are permitted to proceed on the
strength of evidence obtained from the most private &#147;place&#148; in the home on the
basis of misleading, inaccurate, and incomplete Informations upon which a
search warrant was issued. </P>

</SPAN>Justice is blind in the sense that it pays no heed to the social status
or personal characteristics of the litigants.&nbsp; But justice receives a black eye
when it turns a blind eye to unconstitutional searches and seizures as a result
of unacceptable police conduct or practices. </P>

</SPAN>The public must have confidence that invasions of privacy are justified,
in advance, by a genuine showing of probable cause.&nbsp; To admit the evidence in
this case and similar cases in the future would undermine that confidence in
the long term.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

obtained evidence in this case would bring the administration of justice into
disrepute.&nbsp; </P>

an acquittal in its place.</P>

</SPAN>Internet and computer technologies have brought about tremendous changes
in our lives. They facilitate the communication of information and the exchange
of material of all kinds and forms, with both legal and illegal content, and in
infinite quantities.&nbsp; No one can be unaware today that these technologies have
accelerated the proliferation of child pornography because they make it easier
to produce, distribute and access material in partial anonymity: Y. Akdeniz, <I>Internet
Child Pornography and the Law: National and International Responses</I> (2008),
at pp. 1-8. Not only do these technologies increase the availability of child
pornography; they also raise new challenges, as&nbsp; the criminal law must be
adapted to apply to the making, distribution, and possession of such material,
while the resulting offences must be investigated in a manner consistent with
fundamental rights. </P>

</SPAN>The case at bar raises one such challenge. The appellant contends that
the search of his computer breached his rights under s. 8 of the <I>Canadian
Charter</I> <I>of Rights and Freedoms </I>and that the evidence found on the
computer should therefore be excluded and an acquittal entered on a charge of
possession of child pornography (s. 163.1(4)<I> Criminal Code</I>, R.S.C. 1985,
c. C-46). For the reasons that follow, I conclude that the reviewing judge did
not err in upholding the decision to issue the warrant. Consequently, there is
no need to address s. 24(2) of the <I>Charter</I>. I would dismiss the appeal. </P>

</SPAN>In 2002, Adrian Hounjet worked as a computer technician for the Keewatin
Career Development Corporation. He was trained to repair computers and install
high-speed Internet connections. At the time, he was also responsible for
creating software to prevent school children from visiting pornographic sites
and for keeping it up to date.&nbsp; He had accordingly accessed such sites in order
to build a database to support that software, and he was familiar with the
vocabulary of child pornography. </P>

</SPAN>The appellant had ordered a high-speed Internet connection from SaskTel.
On September 5, 2002, Mr. Hounjet arrived unannounced at the appellant&#146;s
residence in La Ronge to perform the installation. The appellant lived with his
wife and two children, aged three and seven, but was alone that day with his
three-year-old daughter. He looked surprised, but allowed Mr. Hounjet in.</P>

</SPAN>Several things he saw, taken together, struck Mr. Hounjet &#147;as a little
bit odd&#148;. The computer was located in a spare bedroom where the three-year-old
child was playing with toys on the floor. He saw that the accused already had
access to the Internet, probably by means of a dial-up service. When he opened
the Web browser, he noticed several links to both adult and child pornography
in the taskbar&#146;s &#147;favourites&#148; list, including two that were labelled &#147;Lolita
Porn&#148; and &#147;Lolita XXX&#148;. He also saw a pornographic image, but he could not
remember afterwards if it was on the browser&#146;s home page or on the computer
desktop. The image was, in his words, &#147;pretty graphic&#148; and he wondered if the appellant&#146;s&nbsp;
wife &#147;let him view and keep it on as their desktop&#148;.&nbsp; From his experience in
building the database for the anti-pornography software, Mr. Hounjet recognized
&#147;Lolita&#148; as a term associated with child pornography.&nbsp; While working on the
computer, he also noticed home videos and, on a tripod, a webcam that was
connected to a videotape recorder and was pointed at the toys and the child
instead of being aimed, as webcams usually are, at the computer user&#146;s seat.
The fact that the camera was pointed at the child would not normally have
struck him as odd, but in light of the links on the computer to pornography, it
troubled him. He did not click on the links to access the websites at that
time. </P>

</SPAN>Unable to finish his work on that day, Mr. Hounjet had to return the
following morning, on September 6, 2002. He then noticed that everything had
been &#147;cleaned up&#148;: the child&#146;s toys had been placed in a box, the videotapes
could no longer be seen, the webcam was pointed at the computer user&#146;s chair
and the computer had been &#147;formatted&#148;. (The only reference in the record to the
meaning of the word &#147;formatted&#148; is in Mr. Hounjet&#146;s statement to the police.
When asked what it meant, he answered: &#147;The whole thing gets erased.&nbsp; The icons
were gone&#148; (A.R., at p. 209).)</P>

</SPAN>Uneasy about what he had seen at the appellant&#146;s residence and having
noted the names of some of the links in the &#147;favourites&#148; list, Mr. Hounjet,
after returning to his place of work, accessed the websites to which they were
related. He saw there what he believed to be child pornography. He testified
that some of the people in the photographs looked &#147;younger than 18 and 15 or 14

</SPAN>Mr. Hounjet continued to think about these events and eventually, in
November 2002, discussed them with his mother, a former social worker. She in
turn contacted the social services office in La Ronge on November 14, 2002. At
that time, Mr. Hounjet&#146;s concerns related to the child&#146;s safety. On November
15, 2002, he went to the social services office and reported what he had seen.
The social worker, Valerie&nbsp; Fosseneuve, contacted the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police (&#147;RCMP&#148;) on November 18, 2002 and reported the information received from
Mr. Hounjet to Cpl. Susan Kusch. Cpl. Kusch then contacted Cpl. Mike Boyce of
the RCMP&#146;s Technological Crime Unit in Regina. Cpl. Boyce confirmed what Mr.
Hounjet had said concerning the names of the websites, stating that &#147;&#145;Lolita&#146;
is an underage porn site that primarily deals with children 14 years old and
under&#148;. About a week later, Cst. Mark Ochitwa was assigned to investigate the

was out of the country for more than a week after being assigned to the
investigation. When he tried to contact Mr. Hounjet on December 17, the latter
was away until Christmas, and then Cst. Ochitwa was on holiday until the
beginning of the new year. Cst. Ochitwa finally obtained Mr. Hounjet&#146;s
statement on January 8, 2003. After the interview, he consulted Cpl. Boyce, who
he knew had experience investigating crimes involving computers and
technological devices. Cpl. Boyce provided information about &#147;media, storage
media, computers, and specifically about this crime that these images are and
would remain on a computer&#148;. He also contacted a Crown Attorney in Regina, who
suggested that he speak with Cst. Randy Huisman of the Saskatoon Police
Service, who had experience investigating child exploitation offences. Cst.
Huisman informed him that &#147;these type of persons treasure collections, child
pornography collections, similar to that of a coin collector or a stamp
collector, and they categorize and catalogue these images and ... their
material&#148;. Cst. Ochitwa also verified whether an active Internet connection was
still being provided to the appellant&#146;s residence. He then drafted an
information to obtain a search warrant (&#147;ITO&#148;).&nbsp; It is reproduced as an

</SPAN>A search warrant was issued on January 10, 2003, and the search was
carried out the same day. Pornographic pictures involving children were found
on the computer, computer disks and/or floppy disks. The appellant was charged
with possession of child pornography contrary to s. 163.1(4) of the <I>Criminal

</SPAN>The search warrant in this case was issued pursuant to the general
search and seizure provision, s. 487 of the <I>Criminal Code</I>. The standard
to be met for the authorization of a search is found in the wording of the

</SPAN>The concept of &#147;reasonable grounds to believe&#148; has been considered by
this Court on numerous occasions. The most frequently cited formulation of the
standard as applicable to the context of a search was articulated by Wilson J.
in <I>R. v. Debot</I>, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 1140, at p. 1166:</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent: 20.85pt;">The question as to what standard of proof must be met
in order to establish reasonable grounds for a search may be disposed of
quickly.&nbsp; I agree with Martin J.A. that the appropriate standard is one of
&#147;reasonable probability&#148;&nbsp; rather than &#147;proof beyond a reasonable doubt&#148; or &#147;<I>prima
facie</I> case&#148;.&nbsp; The phrase &#147;reasonable belief&#148; also approximates the
requisite standard. </P>

</SPAN>The genesis of the addition of the notion of probability to the concept
of reasonable grounds can be traced to <I>Hunter v. Southam Inc.</I>, [1984] 2
S.C.R. 145, at p. 167, where Dickson J. (as he then was) stated that the
Canadian &#147;reasonable grounds to believe&#148; requirement was identical to the
&#147;probable cause&#148; threshold for a search warrant set out in the U.S. <I>Bill of
Rights</I>. The Court described the requirement as &#147;the point where
credibly-based probability replaces suspicion&#148; (p. 167). What Dickson J. was in
fact trying to do in <I>Hunter </I>was to establish a criterion that elevated
the grounds for a search beyond subjective belief and mere suspicion (at p.
167):</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify">The problem is
with the stipulation of a reasonable belief that evidence <U>may</U> be
uncovered in the search. Here again it is useful, in my view, to adopt a
purposive approach. The purpose of an objective criterion for granting prior
authorization to conduct a search or seizure is to provide a consistent
standard for identifying the point at which the interests of the state in such
intrusions come to prevail over the interests of the individual in resisting
them. To associate it with an applicant&#146;s reasonable belief that relevant
evidence <U>may</U> be uncovered by the search, would be to define the proper
standard as the <U>possibility</U> of finding evidence. This is a very low
standard which would validate intrusion on the basis of suspicion, and
authorize fishing expeditions of considerable latitude. It would tip the
balance strongly in favour of the state and limit the right of the individual
to resist, to only the most egregious intrusions. I do not believe that this is
a proper standard for securing the right to be free from unreasonable search
and seizure.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent: 20.85pt;">Anglo&#8209;Canadian legal and political traditions
point to a higher standard. The common law required evidence on oath which gave
&#147;strong reason to believe&#148; that stolen goods were concealed in the place to be
searched before a warrant would issue. Section 443 of the <I>Criminal Code</I>
authorizes a warrant only where there has been information upon oath that there
is &#147;reasonable ground to believe&#148; that there is evidence of an offence in the
place to be searched. The American <I>Bill of Rights</I> provides that &#147;no Warrants
shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation.&hellip;&#148; The phrasing is slightly different but the
standard in each of these formulations is identical. The state&#146;s interest in
detecting and preventing crime begins to prevail over the individual&#146;s interest
in being left alone at the point where credibly&#8209;based probability
replaces suspicion. [Emphasis in the original.]</P>

</SPAN>Determining whether evidence gives rise to a &#147;credibly-based
probability&#148; does&nbsp; not involve parsing the facts or assessing them
mathematically. Rather, what the judge must do is identify credible facts that
make the decision to authorize a search reasonable in view of all the
circumstances. I therefore agree with the non-technical, common-sense approach
taken by Rehnquist J. (as he then was) in <I>Illinois v. Gates</I>, 462 U.S.

decision whether, given all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit before

hearsay information, there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of
a crime will be found in a particular place. [p.&nbsp;238] </P>

</SPAN>Where, as here, a court reviews the validity of a search warrant, it
does not ask whether it would have reached the same decision as the authorizing
judge. It merely determines whether there was credible evidence on which the
decision could be based. This exercise is not a <I>de novo </I>review. In <I>R.
v. Garofoli</I>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1421, at p. 1452, Sopinka J., writing for the
majority, stated:</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent: 20.85pt;">The reviewing judge does not substitute his or her
view for that of the authorizing judge. If, based on the record which was
before the authorizing judge as amplified on the review, the reviewing judge
concludes that the authorizing judge could have granted the authorization, then
he or she should not interfere. In this process, the existence of fraud,
non-disclosure, misleading evidence and new evidence are all relevant, but,
rather than being a prerequisite to review, their sole impact is to determine
whether there continues to be any basis for the decision of the authorizing
judge.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">This test was
applied to the review of the authorization of a search in <I>R. v. Grant</I>,
[1993] 3 S.C.R. 223, and was reiterated by LeBel J. in <I>R. v. Araujo</I>,

&#147;erroneous information is properly excised.... [However, where such]
information results from a simple error and not from a deliberate attempt to
mislead the authorizing judge, amplification may be in order&#148; (<I>Araujo</I>,

issues and conflating the burdens of proof is precisely what my colleague Fish
J. is doing.&nbsp; We are not asked to determine whether the evidence is sufficient

accessing and possession of child pornography and finds support for doing so in

</SPAN>In the case at bar, it is not necessary to provide on exhaustive
definition of the substantive offence of child pornography. Rather, this case
may be decided on the narrower question &#151; limited to the purpose of authorizing
a search warrant &#151; of what might be evidence of reasonable and probable grounds
to believe that a person has committed the offence. However, even where the
purpose is limited to this, it is essential to note that a specific intention
to deal with the object in a particular manner is not an element of the offence
of possession of child pornography.&nbsp; Sections 4(3) and 163.1(4) of the <I>Criminal
Code</I> indicate that possession of child pornography is criminal in and of
itself, irrespective of the use to which the accused intends to put the
prohibited material.&nbsp; The appellant urges the Court to rely on <I>R. v. York</I>,
2005 BCCA 74, 193 C.C.C.(3d) 331, to import a further intent requirement. That
case was also referred to with approval by the majority of the Court of Appeal.
However, the intent requirement from <I>York</I> is inapposite&nbsp; to the offence
of possession of child pornography as set out in the <I>Criminal Code</I>. The
Crown need not demonstrate that an accused intended to &#147;deal&#148; with the
pornographic material in a certain manner.&nbsp; The requisite <I>mens rea </I>will
be established at trial if it is shown that the accused willingly took or
maintained control of the object with full knowledge of its character.&nbsp; It is
reasonable to conclude that in criminalizing simple possession, Parliament has
assumed that an individual who possesses child pornography intends to use it in
a &#147;prohibited manner&#148;.&nbsp; This explains why statutory defences to charges
relating to child pornography are provided in s. 163.1(6) of the <I>Code</I> &#151;
even if the elements of possession are made out, a person will not be convicted
if he or she was in possession of child pornography for a &#147;legitimate purpose&#148;
within the meaning of the <I>Code</I> and does not pose &#147;an undue risk of harm&#148;
to someone under 18 years of age. The purpose for which an individual possesses
child pornography does not change the fact of possession under the <I>Code</I>.&nbsp;
What the defences mean is simply that in certain instances, criminal liability
will not follow from a finding that the offence of possession of child
pornography is made out on the facts. Not only is the Crown not required to
prove at trial that the accused intended to deal with the material in a certain
manner, but it is not necessary when applying for a search warrant to make out
actual possession in the ITO. It is sufficient that there be credible evidence
to support a reasonable belief that the search will uncover evidence of
commission of the offence.</P>

the offence. In asserting that &#147;the images must be present on the computer <I>itself</I>
in order to be in [the] possession&#148; of an accused, he defines control too
narrowly (emphasis in original). As is clear from the wording of s. 4(3)(<I>a</I>)(ii)
of the <I>Criminal Code</I> regarding constructive possession, the accused does
not need to have control in a place belonging to him or her, such as his or her
hard drive.&nbsp; The provision simply requires the material to be &#147;in any place&#148;
for the use or benefit of the accused.</P>

</SPAN>This case does not require the Court to elaborate on the distinctions
between accessing and possession of prohibited material. Suffice it to say that
the question before us turns not on whether the accused has merely viewed the
material, but on whether evidence of control over the material could be found
in the computer that was to be searched. Accessing does not necessarily require
control, and possession does not necessarily require viewing. Therefore, for
the purposes of the offence of possession, viewing might be one way to prove
knowledge of the content, but it is not the only way. Similarly, viewing might
be one way to prove control, but it may not be sufficient &#151; the circumstances
in which the material was viewed would need to be proven. Control, not viewing,
is the defining element of possession.</P>

</SPAN>Therefore, even if an accused does not actually download offending
material, possession is established if the accused has control over the
material for his or her use or benefit or for that of someone else. The record
does not indicate that the reviewing judge was provided any evidence on caches.
However, there is now abundant legal literature in which the authors have
discussed caches, temporary Internet files, and deleted material that can be
retrieved, all of which may, under relevant circumstances, constitute evidence
of possession. The degree of control might be established on the basis, for
example, of the displaying of the images and the ability to select, cut,
enlarge, print, forward or share images: see G. Marin, &#147;Possession of Child

225, <I>R. v. Daniels</I>, 2004 NLCA 73, 242 Nfld. &amp; P.E.I.R. 290, and <I>Chalk</I>,
Canadian courts of appeal have held that the Crown&#146;s burden is one of proving
possession of prohibited material on the basis of control. Acts other than
downloading complete files can be sufficient evidence of control for the
purpose of obtaining a conviction for possession. When, as in <I>Weir</I>, the
material is attached to an e&#8209;mail message, it may &#151; even if the user has
not downloaded it to his hard drive &#151; serve as evidence of possession under
relevant circumstances if, for example, the user either solicited the
attachment or received it voluntarily with knowledge of its content. Similarly,
when, as in <I>Daniels</I>, the computer user initiates the downloading of
images but interrupts it, there is at least evidence of past control of the
prohibited material.&nbsp; Distilled to their essence, these cases confirm that it
is the assertion of control over the prohibited item that is at the core of the
inquiry into whether possession was established, and that there is no
requirement of a specific mode of control.</P>

</SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  When reviewing the authorization of a search for evidence of
possession of child pornography, a court must therefore ask whether there was
credible evidence to support a reasonable belief that an accused had control,
and not, as the appellant contends, that the material had been downloaded and
was in fact in the computer.&nbsp; With control as its focal point, possession must
remain a flexible concept that will be applicable in the diverse contexts in
which it will have to be applied as a result of technological change.</P>

</SPAN>The definition of possession advanced by the appellant and adopted by my
colleague Fish J. could freeze possession in time and limit it to certain modes
of storage and media. As a practical matter, there is little difference between
exercising control over the hard drive of a computer while on the premises
where the computer is located and exercising control over of the on-line space
of a Web-based hosted service. Moreover, if, to bring a cache into the scope of
possession, the accused were required to have knowledge of how caches work,
this would require proof of intent or technical savvy on the part of the
accused.&nbsp; As I mentioned above, the requisite <I>mens rea </I>will be
established at trial if it is shown that the accused willingly took control of
the object with full knowledge of its character. In light of the inevitability
of technological change, it is important not to needlessly handcuff the&nbsp; courts
to a concept of possession that is limited to certain technologies or to current-day
computer practices. Control has been the defining feature of possession, not
the possibility of finding data files on a hard drive. To adopt downloading as
the threshold criterion would be to take a formalistic approach rather than
drawing a principled distinction between access and possession.&nbsp; The classical
approach to possession, rooted in control, therefore remains the most reliable
one. It is the one that is most readily adapted to technological developments
and it will not require courts to hear detailed forensic evidence of
technological advances on an ongoing basis just to keep up with the times. </P>

</SPAN>The rules applicable to the authorization of a search do not change
where the possession of electronic material is in issue. I would add that in view
of the amount of material that can be found on the Internet, it is all the more
important not to unduly restrict the concept of control: printing, enlarging
and sharing are all actions which do not require downloading but may be
evidence of control. Moreover, to limit possession to material downloaded to
the computer of the accused would be to render constructive possession all but
inapplicable in the context of the Internet. As I mentioned above, evidence of
possession can take many forms and, although it must show control, is not
limited to actual possession of the material.</P>

</SPAN>In the case at bar, the ITO appears to concern the likely discovery of
both specified and unspecified types of evidence. Paragraph 15(c) of the ITO
refers to a belief that the appellant would be in possession of &#147;[i]mages that
constitute child pornography&#148;, and para. 16 to searches for the purpose of
finding images &#147;or other evidence in regards to a charge under Section(s)
163.1(4) of the Criminal Code of Canada&#148;. The ITO could have been more precise
with respect, for example, to evidence of control in caches or to the retrieval
of deleted files. However, neither the reviewing judge&#146;s decision nor that of
the Court of Appeal rested on evidence of control derived from caches or retrieved
material, and the failure to be technologically specific is not determinative.</P>

</SPAN>Having concluded that what matters is evidence of possession based on
control of the prohibited material, I cannot accept the appellant&#146;s argument
that the issue is whether the presence of the two links labelled &#147;Lolita Porn&#148;
and &#147;Lolita XXX&#148; in the &#147;favourites&#148; list of the Web browser&#146;s taskbar was
sufficient to establish that the computer would contain downloaded images of
child pornography.&nbsp; The issue is not whether downloaded images would be found,
but whether evidence of possession would. Furthermore, all the circumstances
must be considered, not just the presence of the two links.&nbsp; Bearing the real
issue in mind, I will now turn to the appellant&#146;s arguments that the ITO was
incomplete and that it contained false or boilerplate allegations, and to those
concerning the probative value of the police officers&#146; statements and the
delay. I will conclude by discussing the reviewing judge&#146;s decision in light of
the standards set in <I>Garofoli</I>,<I> Araujo</I> and <I>Pires</I>.</P>

</SPAN>The rule enunciated in <I>Garofoli </I>and<I> Araujo</I> is that where
an ITO contains erroneous or misleading information, the reviewing judge must
expunge that information, which will no longer be admissible. In the present

</SPAN>Before the reviewing judge, the appellant contended that the allegations
relating to the child, the toys and the webcam were inflammatory and
unnecessary. The judge found, on the contrary, that this information had to be
included in the ITO to provide full and frank disclosure.&nbsp; It was required in
order to explain the fact that Mr. Hounjet did not report his concerns to the
police but consulted with his mother first, after which he informed the social
worker, who in turn contacted the RCMP. This explained the delay in applying
for the search warrant.</P>

</SPAN>The appellant formulated his argument in a slightly different way in the
Court of Appeal, as he contended that the ITO contained boilerplate
allegations, omissions, and erroneous statements. He submitted that the failure
to mention that the child observed by Mr. Hounjet was his daughter and that the
informant knew he resided with his wife could have misled the judge by creating
an impression that the webcam and the toys were somehow linked to the offence
of possession of child pornography, whereas there was no evidence supporting a
conclusion that they were. The appellant also contended that the allegation
that &#147;the porn [was] removed&#148; from the computer was false, since no child
pornography was actually seen on the computer.</P>

</SPAN>As the reviewing judge indicated, the information concerning the
presence of the child, the toys, and the webcam was necessary to convey to the
authorizing judge&nbsp; Mr. Hounjet&#146;s concerns about the safety of the child. These
facts prompted Mr. Hounjet to contact the social services office first instead
of the police. This in turn explains part of the delay. From this perspective,
the facts that the appellant was the child&#146;s father and that he resided with
his wife were not determinative.&nbsp; In Mr. Hounjet&#146;s mind, what was at stake was
the safety of <I>a</I> child. In addition, as I will explain below, the
presence of the child, the toys, and the webcam form part of the entire set of
relevant circumstances the authorizing judge could consider in deciding whether
to issue the warrant.</P>

</SPAN>In this Court, the appellant adds that the second paragraph of the ITO
is a boilerplate statement. This paragraph reads:</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;">The Informant is presently involved in an investigation into the
activities of Urbain MORELLI, concerning violations of Section(s) 163.1(4) of
the Criminal Code of Canada and in such capacity have access to and have
reviewed the files and reports of other members of this police force who have been
involved in this investigation and that the information received from them and
referred to herein is based upon these files and reports and/or personal
conversations with them. </P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt; ">[153]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
</SPAN>I cannot accept the appellant&#146;s argument.&nbsp; The paragraph serves as
contextual support for the description of the investigation. It is preceded by
a description of the informant&#146;s duties with the RCMP and by the statement
that, except where otherwise mentioned, he has personal knowledge of the facts,
and that he believes the facts of which he does not have personal knowledge to
be true. In cross-examination, counsel for the appellant drew out the fact that
the only police reports were those of the informant and of the other officer
who was initially contacted by the social worker.</P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt; ">[154]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
</SPAN>Since the details of the investigation are set out in the paragraphs
which follow the impugned statement, the authorizing judge could hardly read
more into this introductory paragraph than what was said in the ITO. The
reviewing judge and the majority of the Court of Appeal did not find that the
allegations in the ITO were misleading and needed to be expunged. Even with
this new argument added by the appellant in this Court, their findings should,
in my view, be upheld. There is no indication that the allegations were meant
to mislead or were so lacking in informational context that they should be
excised from the ITO.</P>

</SPAN>Finally, the appellant argues that the references to the removal of
child pornography are false, because what was actually seen on the computer was
not child pornography, but two links labelled &#147;Lolita Porn&#148; and &#147;Lolita XXX&#148;.&nbsp;
I do not agree with the appellant&#146;s characterization of the statements in the
ITO. There could be no confusion about what was seen. In para. 5 of the ITO,
&#147;Lolita Porn&#148; appears in quotation marks, and it is subsequently referred to in
para. 10 as an &#147;icon&#148;. The information set out in para. 10 is more detailed, as
the informant gives a fuller account there of the statement made by Mr.
Hounjet.&nbsp; There is no question that what had, according to Mr. Hounjet, been&nbsp;
removed from the computer were the links in the &#147;favourites&#148; list to child pornography.
Therefore the authorizing judge must have understood this to be the case.</P>

</SPAN>Hunter J.A., writing for the majority of the Court of Appeal,
acknowledged that the drafting of the ITO was &#147;less than perfect&#148; (para. 51).&nbsp;
But she found that the statements &#147;do not breach the requirement of full and
frank disclosure, nor trick the reader&#148; (para. 58). I agree. Although the ITO
could have been more elaborate in many respects, I agree with both the
reviewing judge and the majority of the Court of Appeal that the omissions the
appellant complains of do not support a conclusion that the ITO was so
deficient that it did not provide the authorizing judge with a sufficiently
credible factual basis.</P>

</SPAN>In paragraph 12 of the ITO, the informant indicated that he had spoken
with Cpl. Boyce, who had stated that &#147;these type[s] of offenders are habitual
and will continue their computer practices with child pornography&#148;.&nbsp; Cpl. Boyce
had added that &#147;this information will remain inside the harddrive of the
computer and can be stored on media devices such as compact disks and floppy
disks&#148;. In paragraph 13, the informant related a conversation with Cst.

</SPAN>More contextual information on both the subject matter of the officers&#146;
statements and their source would have made it easier to understand and assess

</SPAN>The ITO indicated that Cpl. Boyce was with the RCMP&#146;s Technological
Crime Unit in Regina and that Cst. Huisman was with the Saskatoon Police
Service&#146;s Vice Unit. The reviewing judge learned from the examination of the
informant, Cst. Ochitwa, that he had had advance knowledge of Cpl. Boyce&#146;s
expertise in computer technology. Indeed, Cpl. Kusch of the RCMP, who was
originally in charge of the investigation, had also contacted Cpl. Boyce with
regard to the links and their relationship to child pornography. As for Cst.
Huisman, the informant had contacted him at the suggestion of a Crown
prosecutor in Regina. Cst. Ochitwa understood Cst. Huisman to be an expert in
child pornography as a result of conversations he had had both with the Crown
prosecutor and with Cst. Huisman himself.</P>

</SPAN>It was neither inappropriate nor erroneous to rely on the information
provided by Cpl. Boyce and Cst. Huisman about the propensity of child
pornography offenders to collect and hoard such materials. Indeed, this
propensity, which seems to be notorious, has been accepted in numerous child
pornography cases as part of the factual backdrop giving rise to reasonable and
probable grounds for issuing search warrants, and it has also been noted in the
academic commentary on child pornography: <I>R. v. Neveu</I>, 2005 NSPC 51, 239
N.S.R. (2d) 59, at paras. 15&#8209;17; <I>R. v. Fawthrop</I> (2002), O.A.C.

appears to be something law enforcement officials working in computer
technology or vice units encounter frequently. Testimony about this fact cannot
therefore be compared to testimony about novel technology or science: <I>R. v.

</SPAN>I would not dismiss the impugned statements on the basis that, because
the proof of the officers&#146; expertise was insufficient, their statements have no
probative value. Providing the judge with the officers&#146; credentials could have
enhanced or reduced the probative value of their statements.&nbsp; However, the
positions the officers held in their respective forces was sufficient to
support a conclusion that their statements had sufficient probative value to be
included in the ITO.</P>

</SPAN>As for the appellant&#146;s second argument, that there was no basis for the
officers to say that he was a habitual child pornography offender, it can be
disposed of by pointing out that it is not what the officers stated. The
conversations between the informant and the other officers took place several
months after Mr. Hounjet&#146;s visits, and they related to what material might be
found in the computer and whether material would still be found there despite
the time elapsed between the visits and the swearing of the ITO. These are
facts that the informant had to put before the authorizing judge. </P>

</SPAN>In the body of the ITO, the officers&#146; statements were placed after the
description of the facts giving rise to the grounds to believe that evidence of
the commission of the offence would have been found at the time of Mr.
Hounjet&#146;s visits. I agree with the appellant that the statements could not be
used to characterize him as a type of person who is likely to be a child
pornography offender.&nbsp; Indeed, the officers were never asked to make such a
statement about the appellant, and they offered no opinion on this point. </P>

</SPAN>It was for the reviewing judge to decide whether the allegations put

concluding that evidence of the possession of child pornography would likely be
found in the computer.&nbsp; Hunter J.A. agreed with the reviewing judge that they
could.&nbsp; As I explain in greater detail below, I also agree, having regard to

</SPAN>The appellant also contends that the meaning of the expression &#147;type of
offenders&#148; needs to be explained to be understood. I cannot accept this
argument. Although police officers should draft ITOs as precisely and clearly
as possible, reviewing judges must attempt to make sense of the material that
is presented to them and request details or additional information if they feel
an ITO is not clear on an important element. The reviewing judge in this case
concluded, rightly in my view, that the allegations made sense. </P>

</SPAN>The appellant submits that in view of the four-month delay after Mr.
Hounjet had noticed the links on his computer, it was not reasonable to
conclude that he still had the computer in question in his residence and that
any &#147;child pornography&#148; was still in the house when the ITO was sworn.</P>

</SPAN>The issue of the delay was raised &#151; unsuccessfully &#151; both before the
reviewing judge and in the Court of Appeal. The reviewing judge was satisfied
that the inquiry made at SaskTel on January 8, 2003 to determine whether the
appellant had an active Internet connection disposed of any question about
whether the appellant still had his computer.&nbsp; She found:</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;">It logically follows that the subscription could only be utilized with a
computer. The Justice of the Peace could have been satisfied that there was a
basis for Cst. Ochitwa to believe the accused&#146;s computer was in the premises
that were the subject of the search warrant. [para. 21]</P>

</SPAN>In assessing the appellant&#146;s argument on delay, the Court of Appeal also
referred to the statements in the ITO about how material is stored in a
computer. Hunter J.A., for the majority, concluded:</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent: 20.85pt;">Therefore, on reading the whole of the Information,
the delay was disclosed.&nbsp; There was adequate information about the storage of
materials on a computer, together with evidence confirming the current
residence of the appellant and a continuing Internet connection, for the
justice of the peace to have reasonable grounds to believe that the item(s)
sought was in the computer in the appellant&#146;s residence. [para. 50]</P>

</SPAN>This conclusion should, in my view, be upheld.&nbsp; The appellant&#146;s
contention that it was not reasonable for the judge to conclude that the
computer would still be in the residence four months after Mr. Hounjet&#146;s visits
is not valid. Unlike in the case of food or other goods with a short useful
lifespan, there was no reason to presume that the appellant would have changed
his computer within four months after the visits. In addition, there was no
indication that the computer was in any way in need of being replaced. It was
therefore appropriate for the informant to rely on common sense and on the
ongoing subscription to an Internet connection to support his allegation that
the computer was still in the appellant&#146;s residence.&nbsp; A further issue was
whether there would still be evidence of the possession of child pornography in
the computer. Even if it had been doubtful that the <I>same</I> computer was still
in the residence, the police officers&#146; statements concerning the proclivity of
child pornography users to save and collect such material would have alleviated
most concerns about the likelihood of finding evidence of possession of child
pornography.</P>

</SPAN>I have already discussed the admissibility of the statements of Cpl.
Boyce and Cst. Huisman. It was on the issue of the delay that they became
relevant. As stated in the ITO, Cpl. Boyce said that &#147;these type of offenders
are habitual and will continue their computer practices with child
pornography&#148;.&nbsp; He added that &#147;this information will remain inside the hardrive
of the computer and can be stored on media devices&#148;. These statements could
serve as a basis for concluding that it was reasonable to believe that, if the
appellant was this type of offender, evidence of the offence would still be
found in the computer after four months. The evidence in question would relate
to the appellant&#146;s computer practices and would continue to be stored in the
computer or on media devices. Cst. Huisman&#146;s statement, found in the ITO, that
&#147;offenders treasure collections on their computer and like to store them and
create backup&#146;s (<I>sic</I>) in case they loose it (<I>sic</I>)&#148; is also
relevant to the delay.</P>

</SPAN>In child pornography cases, Canadian and American courts have frequently
upheld warrants issued months and even years after the occurrence of the facts
relied upon for the search. In their decisions, they have relied on various
combinations of three elements: the proclivity of offenders to collect child
pornography, the application of common sense in light of the nature of the
material, and the ability of computer forensics examiners to recover data. For
example, in <I>Neveu</I> more than four years had elapsed between the closing
of a website on which paying subscribers accessed child pornography and the
issuance of the warrants. In <I>Neveu</I>, the judge explained his rejection of
a staleness argument as follows:</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent: 20.85pt;">Child pornographic images on the other hand, as
disclosed in the Information to Obtain, are likely held for much longer periods
of time by individuals who purchase them than the items mentioned above. In
addition to relying on the opinion to that effect set out in the Information to
Obtain herein, the issuing Justice could have also concluded, employing her
common sense, that the retention of child pornographic images is likely more
analogous to the lawful acquisition and collection of books, C.D.&#146;s, D.V.D.&#146;s,
photographs, paintings and such items which offer the prospect of ongoing
enjoyment thereby giving them their collectable nature. Collectible items are
distinctively different than items which are consumable or acquired for quick
resale. [para. 15]</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">Similarly in <I>R.

PESCAD 7, 277 Nfld &amp; P.E.I.R. 103, the warrant was initially issued four
years after the alleged downloading (although in that case the warrant was
quashed on review on other grounds). Examples also abound in the United States:
<I>Gourde </I>(four months); <I>Shields</I>, at p. 279 (nine months); <I>Perrine
</I>(111 days); <I>United States v. Terry</I>, 522 F.3d 645 (6th Cir. 2008)

</SPAN>If the offence of possession of child pornography is approached as one
that requires evidence of past or present control of the prohibited material
and does not require evidence that the prohibited material has been downloaded
or permanently saved, little needs to be added on the issue of delay. What does
require examination is the constellation of facts that could serve as a basis
for the judge to characterize the appellant as a &#147;type of offender&#148; who is
likely to collect prohibited material. I will turn to this question now.</P>

</SPAN>In the case at bar, the appellant focuses on the presence of two links

circumstances go beyond the mere presence of those two links.&nbsp; They can be
briefly outlined as follows:</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify">1. <I>Surprise</I>:<I>

sequence of events that followed Mr. Hounjet&#146;s arrival shaped the information
and gave it significance.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify">2. <I>Interest

list of the Web browser&#146;s taskbar. He also noticed a pornographic image, but he
could not remember afterwards if it was on the browser&#146;s home page or on the

</SPAN>The reviewing judge&#146;s task is not to determine whether in his view the
evidence is sufficient to support a finding that the accused is guilty of the
alleged offence. The relevant question is simply whether there was a credible
basis for issuing the warrant. In other words, in the instant case, the
question is whether the facts alleged in the ITO as amplified at the <I>voir
dire</I> were sufficient for the reviewing judge to conclude that there was a
basis for the authorizing judge&#146;s decision. Since the ITO submitted to the
authorizing judge referred to both direct and circumstantial evidence, it is
worth recalling the comments of McLachlin C.J. in <I>R. v. Arcuri</I>, 2001 SCC
54, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 828, at para. 23, concerning the task a judge must perform
in assessing the sufficiency of circumstantial evidence.&nbsp; Although these
comments were made in the context of a preliminary enquiry, they are relevant

circumstantial evidence has been presented:</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent: 20.85pt;">The judge&#146;s task is somewhat more complicated where
the Crown has not presented direct evidence as to every element of the
offence.&nbsp; The question then becomes whether the remaining elements of the
offence &#151;&nbsp; that is, those elements as to which the Crown has not advanced
direct evidence &#151; may reasonably be inferred from the circumstantial evidence.&nbsp;
Answering this question inevitably requires the judge to engage in a limited
weighing of the evidence because, with circumstantial evidence, there is, by
definition, an inferential gap between the evidence and the matter to be
established &#151; that is, an inferential gap <I>beyond</I> the question of whether
the evidence should be believed: see <I>Watt&#146;s Manual of Criminal Evidence</I>,
<I>supra</I>, at &sect;9.01 (circumstantial evidence is &#147;any item of evidence,
testimonial or real, other than the testimony of an eyewitness to a material
fact.&nbsp; It is any fact from the existence of which the trier of fact may infer
the existence of a fact in issue&#148;); <I>McCormick on Evidence</I>, <I>supra</I>,
at pp. 641&#8209;42 (&#147;[c]ircumstantial evidence . . . may be testimonial, but
even if the circumstances depicted are accepted as true, additional reasoning
is required to reach the desired conclusion&#148;).&nbsp; <U>The judge must therefore
weigh the evidence, in the sense of assessing whether it is reasonably capable
of supporting the inferences that the Crown asks the jury to draw.</U>&nbsp; This
weighing, however, is limited.&nbsp; The judge does not ask whether she herself
would conclude that the accused is guilty.&nbsp; Nor does the judge draw factual
inferences or assess credibility.&nbsp; The judge asks only whether the evidence, <I>if

</SPAN>&nbsp;In this case, the authorizing judge had direct evidence of some facts
but many others required inferences. In addition, the evidence was amplified
before the reviewing judge. The appellant&#146;s surprise when Mr. Hounjet arrived
unannounced could reasonably support an inference that he was uncomfortable
giving the technician access to the computer while sensitive material could be
found there.&nbsp; The reviewing judge was told: &#147;The icons themselves that would
appear on the desktop are added by the user themself&#148; (A.R., at p. 134).
Therefore, the facts that there were several links to both adult and child
pornography in the &#147;favourites&#148; list and that a &#147;graphic&#148; pornographic image
was prominently displayed on the computer justified the judge&#146;s drawing the
reasonable inference that the appellant had a conspicuous interest in this type
of material. His specific interest in child pornography was shown by the
deliberate addition to his &#147;favourites&#148; list of links to child pornography. The
fact that there were two links indicated that this interest was pronounced.
Their presence in the &#147;favourites&#148; list also indicated that the appellant
wanted to have easy access to the websites. The position of the camera and the
fact that it was connected to a videotape recorder at the time of the
technician&#146;s first visit, together with the presence of both labelled and
unlabelled videotapes, showed that he was interested in reproducing images,
accumulating such material, and keeping it for his future use. The appellant&#146;s
desire not to arouse suspicion with respect to his reproduction of images or
his computer practices could reasonably be inferred from his actions after
being informed that the technician needed to return: removing the videotapes
from the room, changing the direction the camera was pointed in, reformatting
the computer and, more particularly, removing the suspect image and links.
These actions by the appellant were relatively unexceptional if considered
individually and out of context, but if viewed globally, it was possible for
them to lead the reviewing judge to conclude that the authorizing judge had not
erred in issuing the warrant.&nbsp; There was a credibly based probability that the
appellant was in the habit of reproducing and saving images and had a
propensity to pornography, and more specifically to child pornography.</P>

</SPAN>Once it is accepted that the judge could infer that the appellant
propended towards child pornography, it must also be accepted that he could
conclude that, in view of the appellant&#146;s habit of reproducing and saving
images, there were reasonable grounds to believe that at the time of Mr.
Hounjet&#146;s visits, the appellant was in possession of child pornography. This
conclusion is all the more reasonable in light of the fact that evidence of
sufficient control to establish possession can take many forms and can relate
to past or present possession.</P>

</SPAN>The police officers&#146; statements could not be used to demonstrate that
the appellant was a type of person who was likely to be in possession of child
pornography, but given that there is credible independent evidence of this,
they do shed light on the implications of that evidence. In these
circumstances, the statements that child pornography offenders are collectors
could only make it more likely that evidence of the possession of prohibited
material would still exist at the time Cst. Ochitwa drafted the ITO.</P>

</SPAN>A review by an appellate court of the sufficiency of the initial grounds
for issuing a search warrant remains a delicate exercise. This is why the
grounds for reviewing the authorizing judge&#146;s decision are so narrow. It is
also why deference is owed to the decision of the reviewing judge, who sees and
hears the witnesses. In the case at bar, to echo LeBel J.&#146;s words in<I> Araujo</I>,
I conclude that &#147;there was reliable evidence that might reasonably be believed
on the basis of which the authorization could have issued&#148; (para. 54 (emphasis
deleted)).&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, the reviewing judge and the majority of the Court of
Appeal did not make reversible errors in upholding the authorizing judge&#146;s
decision.</P>

</SPAN>Since I conclude that the search warrant was validly issued, I do not
need to consider the issue of exclusion of the evidence. For these reasons, I
would dismiss the appeal.</P>
