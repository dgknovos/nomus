<DIV class="Section5">

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">The National Post employed M as a journalist.&nbsp; M
investigated whether C, then Prime Minister of Canada, was improperly involved
with a loan from a federally funded bank to a hotel in C&#146;s riding which
allegedly owed a debt to C&#146;s family investment company.&nbsp; X, a secret source,
provided M with relevant information in exchange for a blanket, unconditional
promise of confidentiality.&nbsp; In 2001, M received a sealed envelope in the mail
that contained a document which appeared to be the bank&#146;s authorization of its
loan to the hotel.&nbsp; If genuine, it could show that C had a conflict of interest
in relation to the loan.&nbsp; M faxed copies of the document to the bank, to the
Prime Minister&#146;s office, and to a lawyer for the Prime Minister.&nbsp; All three
said that the document was a forgery.&nbsp; Shortly thereafter, X met M.&nbsp; X
described receiving the document anonymously in the mail, discarding the
original envelope, and passing the document on to M in the belief that it was
genuine. M was satisfied that X was a reliable source who did not believe that
the document was a forgery when he or she forwarded it to M.&nbsp; X feared that
fingerprint or DNA analysis might reveal his or her identity and asked M to
destroy the document and the envelope.&nbsp; M refused but told X that his
undertaking of confidentiality would remain binding as long as he believed that
X had not deliberately misled him.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">The bank complained to the RCMP and an officer asked the
appellants to produce the document and the envelope as physical evidence of the
alleged crimes i.e. the forgery itself and the &#147;uttering&#148; (or putting into
circulation) of the doctored bank records.&nbsp; They refused and M declined to
identify his source.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">The officer applied for a search warrant and an
assistance order compelling M&#146;s editor to assist the police in locating the
document and the envelope.&nbsp; He intended to submit them for forensic testing to
determine if they carried fingerprints or other identifying markings (including
DNA) which might assist in identifying the source of the document.&nbsp; Although
the Crown informed the judge that the National Post had requested notification
of the application, the hearing proceeded <I>ex parte </I>and a search warrant
and an assistance order were issued.</P>

<DIV class="Section6">

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">The warrant and the order provided the appellants with
one month before the RCMP could search the National Post&#146;s premises and
included other terms intended to accommodate the needs of the National Post as
a media entity.&nbsp; The appellants applied to quash the warrant and assistance
order.&nbsp; The reviewing judge held that there was sufficient information to
conclude the document was a forgery but that there was only a remote and
speculative possibility that disclosure of the document and the envelope would
advance a criminal investigation.&nbsp; She set aside the search warrant and the
assistance order.&nbsp; The Court of Appeal reversed that decision and reinstated
the search warrant and the assistance order.&nbsp; In this Court, the appellants and
supporting interveners argued that the warrant and the order should be quashed
because they infringe s.&nbsp;2(<I>b</I>) or s.&nbsp;8 of the <I>Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms</I>, or because the secret sources are protected
by the common law of privilege.</P>

<DIV class="Section7">

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;"><I>Per</I> McLachlin C.J. and <B>Binnie</B>,
Deschamps, Fish, Charron, Rothstein and Cromwell JJ.:&nbsp; It is well established
that freedom of expression protects readers and listeners as well as writers
and speakers.&nbsp; It is in the context of the <I>public</I> right to information
about matters of public interest that the legal position of the confidential
source or whistleblower must be located.&nbsp; The public has an interest in
effective law enforcement.&nbsp; The public also has an interest in being informed
about matters of public importance that may only see the light of day through
the cooperation of sources who will not speak except on condition of
confidentiality.&nbsp; The role of investigative journalism has expanded over the
years to help fill what has been described as a democratic deficit in the
transparency and accountability of our public institutions.&nbsp; There is a
demonstrated need, as well, to shine the light of public scrutiny on the dark
corners of some private institutions.&nbsp; The appellants and their expert
witnesses make a convincing case that unless the media can offer anonymity in
situations where sources would otherwise dry&#8209;up, freedom of expression in
debate on matters of public interest would be badly compromised.&nbsp; Important
stories will be left untold, and the transparency and accountability of our
public institutions will be lessened to the public detriment. </P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">In appropriate circumstances, accordingly, the courts
will respect a promise of confidentiality given to a secret source by a
journalist or an editor.&nbsp; The public&#146;s interest in being informed about matters
that might only be revealed by secret sources, however, is not absolute.&nbsp; It
must be balanced against other important public interests, including the
investigation of crime.&nbsp; In some situations, the public&#146;s interest in
protecting a secret source from disclosure may be outweighed by other competing
public interests and a promise of confidentiality will not in such cases
justify the suppression of the evidence.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<DIV class="Section8">

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">This case involves an attempt by person(s) unknown to
dupe the appellants into publishing a document which, on its face, implicated a
former Prime Minister of Canada in a serious financial conflict of interest.
The appellants were unable to confirm the document&#146;s authenticity and the
police have reasonable grounds to believe that the document is a forgery.&nbsp; The
document and envelope that came into M&#146;s possession constitute physical
evidence reasonably linked to a serious crime.&nbsp; The police seek to subject this
material to forensic analysis.&nbsp; A search to retrieve the physical
instrumentality by which the offence was allegedly committed would likely
satisfy the test in s.&nbsp;487 of the<I> Criminal Code</I>, even if (as the
reviewing judge predicted) forensic analysis of the document and the envelope
do not shed light on the identity of the offender. The document and the
envelope are not merely pieces of evidence tending to show that a crime has
been committed.&nbsp; They constitute the <I>actus reus</I> or <I>corpus delicti</I>
of the alleged offences. </P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">Freedom to publish the news necessarily involves a
freedom to gather the news, but each of the many important news gathering
techniques, including reliance on secret sources, should not itself be regarded
as entrenched in the Constitution. The protection attaching to freedom of
expression is not limited to the &#147;mainstream media&#148;, but is enjoyed by
&#147;everyone&#148; (in the words of s.&nbsp;2(<I>b</I>) of the <I>Charter</I>) who
chooses to exercise his or her freedom of expression on matters of public
interest.&nbsp; To throw a <I>constitutional</I> immunity around the interactions of
such a heterogeneous and ill&#8209;defined group of writers and speakers and
whichever &#147;sources&#148; they deem worthy of a promise of confidentiality and on
whatever terms they may choose to offer it (or, as here, choose to amend it
with the benefit of hindsight) would blow a giant hole in law enforcement and
other constitutionally recognized values such as privacy.&nbsp; The law needs to
provide solid protection against the compelled disclosure of secret sources in
appropriate situations, but the history of journalism in this country shows
that the purpose of s.&nbsp;2(<I>b</I>) can be fulfilled without the necessity
of implying a constitutional immunity.&nbsp; Accordingly, a judicial order to compel
disclosure of a secret source in accordance with the principles of common law
privilege would not in general violate s.&nbsp;2(<I>b</I>). </P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">Although the common law does not recognize a class
privilege protecting journalists from compelled disclosure of secret sources, a
journalist&#146;s claim for protection of secret sources can be assessed properly
using the case&#8209;by&#8209;case model of privilege.&nbsp; The Wigmore criteria
provide a workable structure within which to assess, in light of society&#146;s
evolving values, the sometimes&#8209;competing interests of free expression and
the administration of justice and other values that promote the public
interest.&nbsp; This will provide the necessary flexibility and an opportunity for
growth that is essential to the proper function of the common law. </P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">The scope of the privilege will depend, as does its very
existence, on a case&#8209;by&#8209;case analysis, and may be total or
partial.&nbsp; It is capable, in a proper case, of being asserted against the
issuance or execution of a search warrant. A promise of confidentiality will be
respected if:&nbsp; the communication originates in a confidence that the identity
of the informant will not be disclosed; the confidence is essential to the
relationship in which the communication arises; the relationship is one which
should be sedulously fostered in the public good; and the public interest in
protecting the identity of the informant from disclosure outweighs the public
interest in getting at the truth. This approach properly reflects <I>Charter</I>
values and balances the competing public interests in a context&#8209;specific
manner.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">The media party asking the court to uphold a promise of
confidentiality must prove all four criteria and no burden of proof shifts to
the Crown.&nbsp; This includes, under the fourth criterion, proving that the public
interest in protecting a secret source outweighs the public interest in a
criminal investigation.&nbsp; The weighing up under this criterion will also include
the nature and seriousness of the offence under investigation, and the
probative value of the evidence sought to be obtained measured against the
public interest in respecting the journalist&#146;s promise of confidentiality.&nbsp; The
underlying purpose of the investigation is relevant as well.&nbsp; Until the media
have met all four criteria, no privilege arises and the evidence is presumptively
compellable and admissible.&nbsp; Therefore, no journalist can give a secret source
an absolute assurance of confidentiality.</P>

<DIV class="Section10">

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">In this case, the first three of the four criteria are
met.&nbsp; The communication originated in confidence and neither the journalist&#8209;source
relationship nor the communication would have occurred without
confidentiality.&nbsp; This type of journalist&#8209;source relationship ought to be
sedulously fostered given the importance of investigative journalism exploring
potential conflicts of interest at the highest levels of government. The
appellants, however, have failed to establish the fourth criterion.&nbsp; The
alleged offences are of sufficient seriousness to justify the decision of the
police to investigate the criminal allegations.&nbsp; The physical evidence is
essential to the police investigation and likely essential as well to any
future prosecution.&nbsp; While it is appropriate under this criterion to assess the
likely probative value of the evidence sought, the reviewing judge ought not to
have pre&#8209;empted the forensic investigation by seemingly prejudging the
outcome without first considering all the relevant factors in her assessment.&nbsp;
DNA analysis is capable of producing results even under exceptionally
unpromising circumstances.&nbsp; The police should not be prevented from pursuing
well&#8209;established modes of forensic analysis of relevant physical evidence
on the basis that in the end such analysis may prove to be unsuccessful.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">The argument that there is a &#147;fatal disconnect between
the envelope, the document, the identity of X and the alleged forgery&#148; hinges
on the credibility of X&#146;s story that he or she was not the perpetrator of the
forgery, but an innocent recipient, who passed it on to M in good faith.&nbsp;
However a denial of criminal involvement is not a sufficient ground to put an
end to a serious criminal investigation, even where the intermediate (though
not the ultimate) intended victim of the alleged crime happens to be a media
organization.&nbsp; The police need not accept X&#146;s anonymous, uncorroborated and
self&#8209;exculpatory statements to a third party (M) as a reason to terminate
their investigation of the physical evidence any more than they need accept the
disclaimers of any other potential witness to a crime, especially when the witness
may also be the perpetrator.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">The media&#146;s ss.&nbsp;2(<I>b</I>) and 8 <I>Charter</I>
interests are clearly implicated when the police seek to seize documents in
their possession. Even where no privilege is found to exist, warrants and
assistance orders against the media must take into account their &#147;special
position&#148; and be reasonable in the &#147;totality of circumstances&#148;.&nbsp; It is not
sufficient for the Crown merely to establish that the requirements set out in
ss.&nbsp;487.01 and 487.02 of the <I>Criminal Code</I> were met. In this case
the conditions governing the search ensured that the media organization would
not be unduly impeded by a physical search in the publishing or dissemination
of the news.&nbsp; The order contained the usual clause directing that any documents
seized be sealed on request. The police had reasonable grounds to believe that
criminal offences had been committed and that relevant information would be
obtained.&nbsp; The search warrant was reasonable within the meaning of s.&nbsp;8 of
the <I>Charter</I>.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">On the facts of this case, the <I>ex parte</I> nature of
the issuing judge&#146;s order is not a ground for setting the warrant aside.&nbsp; There
is no jurisdictional requirement to give notice to a media entity of an
application for a warrant to search its premises.&nbsp; The media should have an
opportunity to argue against a warrant at the earliest reasonable opportunity,
but whether and when to provide prior notice remain matters of judicial
discretion.&nbsp; Where, as here, a court proceeds <I>ex parte</I>, adequate terms
must be inserted in the warrant to protect the special position of the media,
and to permit the media ample time and opportunity to challenge the warrant. </P>

<DIV class="Section12">

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">In this case, the issuing judge was aware that the
secret source issue lay at the heart of the controversy, and the appellants&#146;
position was fully protected by the terms of the warrant. They have not
demonstrated any prejudice on that account.&nbsp; The assistance order also was
reasonable.&nbsp; Given the concerted action between M and his editor, it was
appropriate to enlist the editor&#146;s assistance in locating and producing the
concealed documents. </P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">Accordingly, the warrant and assistance order were
properly issued and must be complied with even if the result is to disclose the
identity of the secret source who, the police have reasonable cause to believe,
uttered (and may indeed have created) a forged document.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;"><I>Per</I> <B>LeBel</B> J.:&nbsp;
Claims of journalist&#8209;source privilege should be resolved on a case&#8209;by&#8209;case
basis applying the Wigmore criteria, and there is agreement with the majority&#146;s
weighing of the relevant rights and interests under the fourth criterion of the
analysis. </P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">There is agreement with Abella J. that when an
application for a search warrant is made against a media organization, there is
a presumptive requirement to give notice of the application to the affected
organization.&nbsp; The media play a key role in disseminating information and
triggering debate on public issues.&nbsp; The process of applying for search
warrants should be sensitive to the need to prevent undue or overly intrusive
interference in media operations and affected media organizations should be
able to raise their concerns at the first opportunity.&nbsp; The requirement to give
notice may be waived in urgent situations, in which case the issuing judge
should craft conditions to limit interference with the media organization&#146;s
operations.&nbsp; In this case, since the lack of notice did not make the search
unreasonable and the issuing judge proceeded on the basis of established law,
the search warrant should not be quashed.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;"><I>Per</I> <B>Abella J. </B>(dissenting):&nbsp;
Journalist&#8209;source privilege should be assessed on a case&#8209;by&#8209;case
basis.&nbsp; The balancing of the interests of the press against other societal
interests, such as crime prevention, prosecution and investigation, should be
done in accordance with the four Wigmore criteria, infused with <I>Charter</I>
values.&nbsp; In this case, the search warrant and assistance order should be
quashed. The criteria are met, including the fourth criterion, which requires
the claimant to demonstrate that the injury that would inure to the
relationship by the disclosure of the communications is greater than the
benefit thereby gained for the correct disposal of the litigation.&nbsp; The harm
caused by the disclosure of the identity of the confidential source in this
case is far weightier on the scales than any benefit to the investigation of
the crime. </P>

<DIV class="Section14">

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  The media&#146;s role in disseminating information is
pivotal in its contribution to public debate, and the use of confidential
sources can be an integral part of the responsible gathering of the news and
the communication of&nbsp; matters of public interest.&nbsp; Several jurisdictions have
already recognized the importance of confidential sources by granting,
legislatively or judicially, some form of qualified privilege to journalists.
The chilling effect that could result from the compelled exposure of
confidential journalistic sources also cannot be ignored.&nbsp; In the case before
us, X&#146;s confidentiality was crucial to M&#146;s ability to write on a subject of
public interest.&nbsp; M had prior positive experiences with X where he had been
able to confirm the authenticity of information provided by X via an
intermediary.&nbsp; He also took steps to assure himself of X&#146;s credibility and
integrity in connection with the latest document by asking for a confidential
affidavit and telling X that his/her confidentiality would only be protected if
M were satisfied that he was not being misled.&nbsp; Where a journalist has taken
credible and reasonable steps to determine the authenticity and reliability of
a source, one should respect his or her professional judgment and pause before
trespassing on the confidentiality which is the source of the relationship.&nbsp; In
this case, demonstrable and profound injury to the journalist/source
relationship will result from disclosure of the documents and potentially of
the identity of the source.&nbsp; </P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">On the other side of the balancing exercise, the
benefits of disclosure range from speculative to negligible.&nbsp; While it is
undisputed that the investigation of crime is an important public objective,
the evidence sought by the state is of only questionable assistance in this
case.&nbsp; The police hoped to find DNA and fingerprint evidence on the envelope
and the document which they thought might reveal the identity of the source of
the alleged forgery.&nbsp; However, there is a fatal disconnect between the
envelope, the document, the identity of X and the alleged forgery.&nbsp; X received
the document anonymously and discarded the original envelope in which he/she
received the document.&nbsp; Since X does not know the identity of the sender, learning
X&#146;s identity will yield virtually no evidence that could assist in determining
who was responsible for the alleged forgery.&nbsp; Moreover, the more documents are
manipulated, the less likely the chances of obtaining fingerprints.&nbsp; Both the
document and the envelope had been extensively handled.&nbsp; X is therefore in no
position to provide any information of assistance to the investigation and is,
in any event, under no legal obligation to speak to the police.&nbsp; The benefit to
the forgery investigation of getting the documents is, therefore, at best
marginal.&nbsp; The only remaining purpose for learning the confidential source&#146;s
identity is to discover who created this public controversy.&nbsp; This by itself is
not an acceptable basis for interfering with freedom of the press.&nbsp; Lastly, the
remote possibility of resolving the debt forgery &#151; a crime of moderate
seriousness &#151; is far from sufficiently significant to outweigh the public
benefit in protecting a rigorously thorough and responsible press. </P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">A search warrant of media premises is a particularly
serious intrusion, and a decision should not be made about its propriety
without submissions from the party most affected.&nbsp; The operating presumption
should be that the media&#146;s unique institutional character entitles it to notice
when a search warrant is sought against it unless there are urgent
circumstances justifying an <I>ex parte </I>hearing.&nbsp; No such notice was given
to the National Post and there was no such urgency.&nbsp; It therefore lost the
opportunity to make timely submissions on the confidential nature of the source
and the serious informational gaps in the Information to Obtain.&nbsp; Had the
fuller record and their arguments been known, the outcome of the hearing might
have been different. </P>

</SPAN>The public has the right to every person&#146;s evidence.&nbsp; That is the
general rule.&nbsp; The question raised by this appeal is whether the appellants can
exempt themselves from this obligation on the basis of a journalistic privilege
rooted either in s. 2(<I>b</I>) of the <I>Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms</I> which guarantees freedom of expression, &#147;including freedom of the
press and other media of communication&#148;, or in the common law.</P>

</SPAN>Specifically, the <I>National Post</I>, its editor-in-chief and one of
its journalists apply to&nbsp; set aside a search warrant obtained from the Ontario
Court of Justice authorizing the police to seize what are alleged to be forged
bank records and the envelope in which the appellants received the records from
secret source(s).&nbsp; The police believe that seizure of the physical documents is
essential to proof of the forgery, and that forensic analysis may lead them
directly or indirectly to the identity of the perpetrators.&nbsp; The appellants,
for their part, seek to protect the identity of their secret source(s), who may
or may not be directly implicated in the forgery.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the police are correct,
therefore, the documents in the control of the <I>National Post</I> and its
co-appellants are not merely links in the chain of criminal investigation but
constitute in themselves the essential physical evidence of alleged crimes &#151;
the forgery itself and the &#147;uttering&#148; (or putting into circulation) of the
doctored bank records in the plain brown envelope.</P>

</SPAN>The courts should strive to uphold the special position of the media and
protect the media&#146;s secret sources where such protection is in the public
interest, but this is not the usual case of journalists seeking to avoid
testifying about their secret sources.&nbsp; This is a physical evidence case.&nbsp; It
involves what is reasonably believed to be a forged document.&nbsp; Forgery is a
serious crime.&nbsp; For the reasons that follow I agree with the Ontario Court of
Appeal (2008 ONCA 139, 89 O.R. (3d) 1) that the media claim to immunity from
production of the physical evidence is not justified in the circumstances
disclosed in the evidence before the court even if the end result proves to be
information that may lead to the identification of the secret source(s).&nbsp; I
would dismiss the appeal.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm; ">[4]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
</SPAN>This dispute is a controversy of undoubted public importance.&nbsp; It
involves an attempt by a person or persons unknown to dupe the <I>National Post</I>
into publishing an allegedly forged bank document which, on its face,
implicated the then Prime Minister of Canada, Jean Chr&eacute;tien, in a serious
financial conflict of interest.&nbsp; The courts below concluded that the police
possess reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the inculpatory entries
on the &#147;leaked&#148; document are false.&nbsp; The document, if authentic, would have
suggested that at the same time the Prime Minister was said to be exerting
influence on the federal Business Development Bank of Canada (&#147;BDBC&#148;) to grant
a $615,000 loan to the Auberge Grand-M&egrave;re, a private business in his riding,
the Auberge Grand-M&egrave;re allegedly owed the Chr&eacute;tien family investment company
$23,040.&nbsp; Unless the Auberge Grand-M&egrave;re could be saved from insolvency, the
story went, the debt would likely go unpaid.&nbsp; The Prime Minister&#146;s private
financial interest, on this theory of events, conflicted with his public duty.&nbsp;
Some in the media referred to cluster of events around the loan controversy as
&#147;Shawinigate&#148;.</P>

</SPAN>The public interest in freedom of expression is of immense importance
but it is not absolute and in circumstances such as the present it must be
balanced against other important public interests, including the investigation
and suppression of crime.&nbsp;&nbsp; The courts understand the need in appropriate
circumstances to protect from disclosure the identity of secret sources who
provide the media, on condition of confidentiality, with information of public
interest, but even the journalist Andrew McIntosh recognized that if his source
had provided the document &#147;to deliberately mislead me&#148; the source would no
longer be worthy of protection (A.R., vol. 4, p. 1, McIntosh Affidavit, at
para. 227).&nbsp;&nbsp; It is true that Mr. McIntosh believed his source to be sincere.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, according to Mr. McIntosh, the source acknowledged participation
(he or she says innocently) in forwarding the alleged forgery.&nbsp; There would not
be many successful criminal investigations if the police were required to
accept at face value protestations of innocence by unknown persons relayed at
third hand.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

</SPAN>The reviewing judge, Benotto J., quashed the warrant in part because she
considered it unlikely that the outcome of the forensic analysis of the
appellants&#146; documents would be successful.&nbsp; With respect, I do not think the
possibility of failure is a reason to prevent the police from undertaking
forensic inquiry by well-established techniques such as DNA analysis of
documents which the appellants concede are reasonably linked to the alleged
criminal offences.&nbsp; A search to retrieve the physical instrumentality by which
the offence was allegedly committed would likely satisfy the test in s. 487 of
the <I>Criminal Code</I>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, even if the documents did not
shed light on the identity of the offender.&nbsp; Moreover, if Benotto J. is
correct, and the envelope is unlikely to identify the confidential source, then
there is little public interest in refusing its production to the police.</P>

</SPAN>In terms of the <I>Charter</I>, the appellants go too far in claiming a
broad immunity from production of physical evidence.&nbsp; A claim that secret
sources may be disclosed is not a complete answer to a criminal investigation.&nbsp;
I conclude that the warrant in question does not infringe the appellants&#146; s. 2(<I>b</I>)
<I>Charter</I> freedom of expression.&nbsp; Nor, in my view, are the documents in
question protected by a common law journalistic privilege.&nbsp; Nor, for the
reasons to be discussed, does the warrant at issue in this case give rise to an
unreasonable search or seizure within the meaning of s. 8 of the <I>Charter</I>.&nbsp;
Journalistic privilege is very context specific.&nbsp; The appellants have not, in
my view, made out their claim on the facts.&nbsp; The warrant is valid.</P>

</SPAN>The appellant Andrew McIntosh was employed by the <I>National Post</I>
from August 1998 until February 2005.&nbsp; He took an interest in then Prime Minister
Jean Chr&eacute;tien&#146;s involvement with the Grand-M&egrave;re Golf Club located in Mr.
Chr&eacute;tien&#146;s home riding of St-Maurice, Quebec.&nbsp; His investigation led him to
suspect Mr. Chr&eacute;tien&#146;s involvement with a 1997 loan from the BDBC to the
Auberge Grand-M&egrave;re, a hotel located next to the golf club, and with other
federal grants in the riding.&nbsp; During his investigations, Mr. McIntosh
contacted a person known to us only as X, but at that time X was unwilling to
talk to Mr. McIntosh, even on a confidential basis.</P>

</SPAN>However, in the Fall of 2000, another individual known only as Y
contacted Mr. McIntosh and indicated that he or she had important information
but would only disclose it in return for a promise of confidentiality.&nbsp; Mr.
McIntosh was generally authorized by the then editor-in-chief of the <I>National
Post</I> to give promises of confidentiality and he routinely did so.&nbsp; The
editor-in-chief testified that he considers himself a party to such promises of
confidentiality.&nbsp; Indeed, the reviewing judge found that &#147;[a]ll of Mr.
McIntosh&#146;s work was done with the support of the then Editor-in-Chief&#148; ((2004),
69 O.R. (3d) 427, at para. 8).&nbsp; </P>

X was willing to provide McIntosh with documents and information concerning the
Auberge Grand-M&egrave;re loan.&nbsp; Based on materials received from Y, including what
appeared to be copies of original documents from BDBC files and information
received from other sources, Mr. McIntosh reported in the <I>National Post</I>
that Mr. Chr&eacute;tien had called the president of the BDBC and urged approval of
the bank loan to Auberge Grand-M&egrave;re.&nbsp; When asked by reporters to comment, Mr.
Chr&eacute;tien acknowledged that the story was accurate.&nbsp; Numerous articles followed.</P>

</SPAN>On April 5, 2001, Mr. McIntosh received a sealed plain brown envelope at
the Ottawa Bureau of the <I>National Post</I>.&nbsp; The envelope contained a
document that appeared to be a copy of a BDBC internal loan authorization for a
$615,000 mortgage to Les Entreprises Yvon Duhaime Inc. (Auberge Grand&#8209;M&egrave;re)
in August 1997.&nbsp; On the face of it, the document purported to show that, at the
time it applied for and received the loan, Auberge Grand&#8209;M&egrave;re listed an
outstanding debt of $23,040 to &#147;JAC Consultants&#148;,&nbsp; a Chr&eacute;tien family investment
company.&nbsp; Mr. McIntosh concluded that if the document were genuine, it would
represent a major escalation in the Shawinigate story.</P>

All three said that the document was a forgery.&nbsp; The BDBC sent two letters to
the <I>National Post </I>on April 6, 2001.&nbsp; The first claimed that the BDBC&#146;s
records showed no indication of a debt owed to JAC Consultants.&nbsp; In the second
letter, the BDBC warned the <I>National Post </I>that bank documents were
confidential and should not be disclosed.&nbsp; A short time after receiving these
letters, Mr. McIntosh put the document and its envelope somewhere, he claims,
where only he is able to access them.</P>

</SPAN>The Bloc Quebecois also received a copy of the BDBC &#147;document&#148; which it

that after waiting two hours (to give the appellants an opportunity for

and speculative possibility that the fingerprints were those of the alleged
forgerer&#148; and &#147;[d]isclosure of the document will minimally, if at all, advance
the investigation while at the same time damage freedom of expression&#148; (para.

decision was reversed by the Ontario Court of Appeal on February 29, 2008 in

breaking a promise of confidentiality or being held in contempt of court.&nbsp; See,
e.g. <I>St. Elizabeth Home Society v. Hamilton (City)</I>, 2008 ONCA 182, 230
C.C.C. (3d) 199.&nbsp; Nevertheless, most journalistic codes of ethics recognize
that the promise of confidentiality cannot be absolute, see e.g. the Canadian
Association of Journalists&#146; <I>Guidelines for Investigative Journalism</I>
regarding &#147;[u]se of confidential and anonymous sources&#148;.</P>

</SPAN>Our Court has previously recognized the special position of the news
media in two search warrant cases that did not involve secret sources, namely <I>Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation v. Lessard</I>, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 421, and <I>Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation v. New Brunswick (Attorney General)</I>, [1991] 3
S.C.R. 459.&nbsp;&nbsp; In these cases, Cory J., for the majority, emphasized that a
justice of the peace or judge must &#147;consider <U>all the circumstances</U> in
determining whether to exercise his or her discretion to issue a warrant&#148; (<I>Lessard</I>,
at p. 445 (emphasis added)).&nbsp; The majority of the Court laid down nine
principles applicable to media cases, and in particular:</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify">The justice of
the peace should ensure that a balance is struck between the competing
interests of the state in the investigation and prosecution of crimes and the
right to privacy of the media in the course of their news gathering and news
dissemination.&nbsp; It must be borne in mind that the media play a vital role in
the functioning of a democratic society.&nbsp; Generally speaking, the&nbsp; news media will
not be implicated in the crime under investigation.&nbsp; They are truly an innocent
third party.&nbsp; This is a particularly important factor to be considered in
attempting to strike an appropriate balance, including the consideration of
imposing conditions on that warrant.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent: 20.85pt;">. . . Although it is not a constitutional
requirement, the affidavit material should ordinarily disclose whether there
are alternative sources from which the information may reasonably be obtained
and, if there is an alternative source, that it has been investigated and all
reasonable efforts to obtain the information have been exhausted. [p. 445]</P>

</SPAN>The appellants and their media supporters argue that these principles
are too general.&nbsp; The media interest, they say, is not just one of many factors
to be taken into account in &#147;all of the circumstances&#148;.&nbsp; The <I>Charter</I>,
they contend, entitles them to greater protection than <I>Lessard</I> and <I>New
Brunswick</I> provide.&nbsp; Thus, armed with ss. 2(<I>b</I>) and 8 of the <I>Charter</I>,
the appellants seek a re-examination of the existing law.&nbsp; The Court of Appeal
in this case, they say, focussed too narrowly on the needs of law enforcement
while downplaying, if not effectively ignoring, the broader public interest in
the media being able to play its important role as public watchdog.&nbsp; This
skewed perspective led the court, the appellants argue, to relieve the Crown of
the usual and appropriate onus of establishing that compelled disclosure in
this case was a demonstrable limit on the constitutionally guaranteed freedom
of expression in a free and democratic society. </P>

</SPAN>In <I>Lessard</I> and <I>New Brunswick</I>, the Court accepted that
freedom to&nbsp; publish the news necessarily involves a freedom to gather the
news.&nbsp; We should likewise recognize in this case the further step that an
important element in the news gathering function (especially in the area of
investigative journalism) is the ability of the media to make use of
confidential sources.&nbsp; The appellants and their expert witnesses make a
convincing case that unless the media can offer anonymity in situations where
sources would otherwise dry-up,&nbsp; freedom of expression in debate on matters of
public interest would be badly compromised.&nbsp; Important stories will be left
untold, and the transparency and accountability of our public institutions will
be lessened to the public detriment.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:78.45pt;text-align:justify;text-indent: -20.85pt;">&#150; &nbsp;&nbsp;  Firstly, how should the journalists&#146; claim for
protection of secret sources be characterized in law?&nbsp; In particular, does s.
2(<I>b</I>) of the <I>Charter</I> create a constitutionally entrenched immunity
to protect journalists against the compelled disclosure of secret sources, and
if so, in what circumstances may breaches of such an immunity be justified
under s. 1?</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:78.45pt;text-align:justify;text-indent: -20.85pt;">&#150; &nbsp;&nbsp;  Secondly, if there is no such s. 2(<I>b</I>)
immunity, is there nevertheless a common law privilege, to be applied in light
of the important public interest in freedom of expression, and if so, is it
properly conceived of as a class privilege or a case-by-case privilege? </P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:78.45pt;text-align:justify;text-indent: -20.85pt;">&#150; &nbsp;&nbsp;  Thirdly, if the journalist-confidential source
privilege is constituted on a case-by-case basis, what are the elements that
must be established, and who has the onus to do so?&nbsp; This was the main

</SPAN>The broadest conception was put forward by the intervener Canadian Civil
Liberties Association (&#147;CCLA&#148;) supported in part by the intervener the British
Columbia Civil Liberties Association (&#147;BCCLA&#148;).&nbsp; In their view, the applicable
concept is not a common law privilege but some form of constitutional immunity
against compelled disclosure of secret sources.&nbsp; The CCLA argues that a s. 2(<I>b</I>)&nbsp;
immunity is established by a claimant showing (i) that he or she is a
journalist; (ii) engaged in news gathering activity; (iii) who has acquired
information under a promise of confidentiality (transcript, at p. 42).&nbsp; At that
point, the CCLA submits, testimonial immunity against disclosure of the source
is constitutionally guaranteed subject to the Crown being able to show a
countervailing and fact-specific overriding public interest through what the
CCLA called &#147;a full press Section 1 analysis&#148; (p. 45).&nbsp; Reliance is placed on <I>Dagenais
v. Canadian Broadcasting Corp.</I>, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 835, which recognized the
importance of free expression even in the context of ensuring trial fairness.&nbsp;
The BCCLA advances a similar series of propositions derived, it argues, from
the dissent of McLachlin J. (now Chief Justice) in <I>Lessard</I>.</P>

</SPAN>The position of the CCLA and the BCCLA is built on the premise that
protection of confidential sources should be treated as if it were an
enumerated <I>Charter</I> right or freedom.&nbsp; But this is not so.&nbsp; What is
protected by s. 2(<I>b</I>) is freedom of expression.&nbsp; News gathering, while
not specifically mentioned in the text of s. 2(<I>b</I>) is implicit in news
publication, but there are many techniques of news gathering and it carries the
argument too far, in my view, to suggest that each of those news gathering
techniques (including reliance on secret sources) should itself be regarded as
entrenched in the Constitution.&nbsp; Chequebook journalism is also a routine method
of gathering the news, but few would suggest that this too should be
constitutionalized.&nbsp; Journalists are quick to use long-range microphones,
telephoto lenses or electronic means to hear and see what is intended to be
kept private (as in the case of then Finance Minister Marc Lalonde whose budget
had to be amended because a cameraman captured parts of what were intended to
be secret budget documents on Mr. Lalonde&#146;s desk).&nbsp; Such techniques may be
important for journalists (who, unlike prosecutors, have to get along without
the power of subpoena), but this is not to say that just because they <I>are</I>
important that news gathering techniques as such are entrenched in the
Constitution.</P>

</SPAN>The courts have leaned against conferring constitutional status on
testimonial immunities.&nbsp; Even solicitor-client privilege, one of the most
ancient and powerful privileges known to our jurisprudence, is generally seen
as a &#147;fundamental and substantive rule of law&#148; (<I>R. v. McLure</I>, 2001 SCC
14, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 445, at para. 17), rather than as &#147;constitutional&#148; even
though solicitor-client privilege is supported by and impressed with the values
underlying s. 7 of the <I>Charter</I>.</P>

</SPAN>There are cogent objections to the creation of such a &#147;constitutional&#148;
immunity.&nbsp; As recently pointed out in <I>Grant v. Torstar Corp.</I>, 2009 SCC
61, [2009] 3 S.C.R. 640, the protection attaching to freedom of expression is
not limited to the &#147;traditional media&#148;, but is enjoyed by &#147;everyone&#148; (in the
words of s. 2(<I>b</I>) of the <I>Charter</I>) who chooses to exercise his or
her freedom of expression on matters of public interest whether by blogging,
tweeting, standing on a street corner and shouting the &#147;news&#148; at passing
pedestrians or publishing in a national newspaper.&nbsp; To throw a constitutional
immunity around the interactions of such a heterogeneous and ill-defined group
of writers and speakers and whichever &#147;sources&#148; they deem worthy of a promise
of confidentiality and on whatever terms they may choose to offer it (or, as
here, choose to amend it with the benefit of hindsight) would blow a giant hole
in law enforcement and other constitutionally recognized values such as
privacy.</P>

</SPAN>The law needs to provide solid protection against the compelled
disclosure of secret source identities in appropriate situations but the
history of journalism in this country shows that the purpose of s. 2(<I>b</I>)
can be fulfilled without the necessity of implying a constitutional immunity.&nbsp;
Accordingly, a judicial order to compel disclosure of a secret source would not
in general violate s. 2(<I>b</I>).&nbsp; There is thus no need on this branch of the
case to consider a s. 1 justification.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm; ">[42]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
</SPAN>At common law, privilege is classified as either relating to a class&nbsp;
(e.g. solicitor and client privilege) or&nbsp; established on a case-by-case basis.&nbsp;
In a class privilege what is important is not so much the content of the
particular communication as it is the protection of the type of relationship.&nbsp;
Once the relevant relationship is established between the confiding party and
the party in whom the confidence is placed, privilege presumptively cloaks in&nbsp;
confidentiality matters properly within its scope without regard to the
particulars of the situation.&nbsp; Class privilege necessarily operates in
derogation of the judicial search for truth and is insensitive to the facts of
the particular case.&nbsp; Anything less than this blanket confidentiality,&nbsp; the
cases hold, would fail to provide the necessary assurance to the solicitor&#146;s
client or the police informant to do the job required by the administration of
justice.&nbsp; The law recognizes very few &#147;class privileges&#148; and as Lamer C.J.
observed in rejecting the existence of a class privilege for communications
passing between pastor and penitent in <I>R. v. Gruenke</I>, [1991] 3 S.C.R.

evidence is admissible until proven otherwise. [p. 288]</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

</SPAN>Journalistic-confidential source privilege has not previously been
recognized as a class privilege by our Court (<I>Moysa v. Alberta (Labour
Relations Board)</I>, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1572), and has been rejected by courts in
other common law jurisdictions with whom we have strong affinities.&nbsp; The
reasons are easily stated.&nbsp; First is the immense variety and degrees of
professionalism (or the lack of it) of persons who now &#147;gather&#148; and &#147;publish&#148;
news said to be based on secret sources.&nbsp; In contrast to the legal profession
there is no formal accreditation process to &#147;licence&#148; the practice of journalism,
and no professional organization (such as a law society) to regulate its
members and attempt to maintain professional standards.&nbsp; Nor, given the scope
of activity contemplated as journalism in <I>Grant v. Torstar</I>, could such
an organization be readily envisaged.</P>

</SPAN>A second problem arises in determining&nbsp; the respective rights and
immunities of the journalist and the source to whom confidentiality has been
promised.&nbsp; In the past, secret sources have voluntarily stepped out from the
shadows to reveal themselves (as in the <I>St. Elizabeth Home</I> case) with or
without the journalist&#146;s consent.&nbsp; Is the journalist now to be given the right
to object because, for example, disclosure might reveal &#147;journalist methods&#148;
and &#147;journalistic networks&#148;?&nbsp; I do not think such a restriction would in
general serve the public interest in the search for truth.&nbsp; On the other hand,
the source cannot be said to be the holder of the privilege if, as here, the
journalist reserves the right to &#147;out&#148; the secret source unilaterally if, in
the journalist&#146;s personal view, the conditions on which anonymity were offered
have not been met.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of solicitors and their clients, the privilege
clearly belongs to the client.&nbsp; Are we to say that journalistic privilege
attaches both to the journalist and the secret source?&nbsp; If so, what happens if
they fall into disagreement?&nbsp; It is particularly important in the case of class
privilege that the rules be clear in advance to all participants so that they
may govern themselves accordingly.</P>

</SPAN>Thirdly, no one has suggested workable criteria for the creation or loss
of the claimed immunity.&nbsp; The evidence shows that journalistic practice varies
considerably as to when promises of confidentiality are properly made.&nbsp; Many
news organizations require the journalist to consult with an editor before
making such a promise.&nbsp; Others, including the <I>National Post</I>, do not.&nbsp;
What would be the criteria for such a class privilege to apply?&nbsp; The various
media codes of ethics are themselves in disagreement.&nbsp; In the present case, Mr.
McIntosh&#146;s original &#147;blanket, <U>unconditional</U> promise of confidentiality
to protect the identity of both X and Y&#148; (McIntosh Affidavit, at para. 156
(emphasis added)) became burdened with an important condition.&nbsp; It was
retroactively modified by Mr. McIntosh to last only so long as Mr. McIntosh
personally &#147;believed that [X] had not provided the document to deliberately
mislead me&#148; (para. 227).&nbsp; Mr. McIntosh says his secret source agreed to this
modification, but at that point he or she was not in much of a bargaining
position having already delivered up the documents to the appellants.&nbsp;&nbsp;  What
are the limits to retroactive modification of the journalist&#146;s undertaking?&nbsp;
Must the secret source consent to the modification?&nbsp; The media argument raises
more questions about the scope and operation of the claimed class privilege
than it provides solutions.</P>

reasons to believe that his testimony implicates confidential source
relationships without a legitimate need of law enforcement, he will have access
to the court on a motion to quash and an appropriate protective order may be
entered.&nbsp; The asserted claim to privilege should be judged on its facts by the
striking of a proper balance between freedom of the press and the obligation of
all citizens to give relevant testimony with respect to criminal conduct.&nbsp; <U>The
balance of these vital constitutional and societal interests on a case-by-case
basis accords with the tried and traditional way of adjudicating such
questions.</U>&nbsp; [Emphasis added; p. 710.]</P>

Parliament has created a presumptive immunity in defined circumstances, subject

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:78.45pt;text-align:justify;">No court may require a person to disclose, nor is any person guilty of
contempt of court for refusing to disclose, the source of information contained

justice or national security or for the prevention of disorder or crime.</P>

</SPAN>As mentioned, <I>Gruenke</I> dealt with a claim for confidentiality for

was said to be required by the s. 2(<I>a</I>) <I>Charter </I>guarantee of
freedom of religion and conscience.&nbsp; Despite the constitutional protection for
freedom of religion, the Court rejected the existence of a class privilege but
adopted instead Professor Wigmore&#146;s distillation and synthesis of a wide range
of situations where privilege has been recognized on a case-by-case basis.&nbsp;
Here the law finds a mechanism with the necessary flexibility to weigh up and
balance competing public interests in a context-specific manner.</P>

</SPAN>When applied to journalistic secret sources, the case-by-case privilege,
if established on the facts, will not necessarily be restricted to testimony,
i.e. available only at the time that testimony is sought from a journalist in
court or before an administrative tribunal.&nbsp; The protection offered may go
beyond a mere rule of evidence.&nbsp; Its scope is shaped by the public interest
that calls the privilege into existence in the first place.&nbsp; It is capable, in
a proper case, of being asserted against the issuance or execution of a search
warrant, as in <I>O&#146;Neill</I> <I>v. Canada (Attorney General)</I> (2006), 213
C.C.C. (3d) 389 (Ont. S.C.J.).&nbsp; The scope of the case-by-case privilege will
depend, as does its very existence, on a case-by-case analysis, and may be
total or partial (<I>Ryan</I>, at para. 18).</P>

</SPAN>The &#147;Wigmore criteria&#148; consist of four elements which may be expressed&nbsp;
for present purposes as follows.&nbsp; First, the communication must originate in a
confidence that the identity of the informant will not be disclosed.&nbsp; Second,
the confidence must be essential to the relationship in which the communication
arises. Third, the relationship must be one which should be &#147;sedulously
fostered&#148; in the public good (&#147;Sedulous[ly]&#148; being defined in the <I>New
Shorter Oxford English Dictionary on Historical Principles</I> (6th ed. 2007),
vol. 2, at p. 2755, as &#147;diligent[ly] . . . deliberately and consciously.&#148;).&nbsp;
Finally, if all of these requirements are met, the court must consider whether
in the instant case the public interest served by protecting the identity of
the informant from disclosure outweighs the public interest in getting at the
truth.&nbsp; See <I>Wigmore on Evidence</I> (McNaughton Rev. 1961), vol. 8, at &sect;
2285; <I>Sopinka, Lederman and Bryant: The Law of Evidence in Canada</I> (3rd
ed. 2009), at paras. 14.19 <I>et seq.</I>; D. M. Paciocco and L. Stuesser, <I>The
Law of Evidence</I> (3rd ed. 2002), at pp. 163-67.&nbsp; Further, as Lamer C.J.
commented in <I>Gruenke</I>:</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;">This is not to say that the Wigmore criteria are now &#147;carved in stone&#148;,
but rather that these considerations provide a general framework within which
policy considerations and the requirements of fact-finding can be weighed and
balanced on the basis of their relative importance in the particular case
before the court. [p. 290]</P>

</SPAN>It is of passing interest that Professor Wigmore himself was not a
supporter of journalistic-secret source privilege.&nbsp; He described an early
legislative attempt to craft a shield law (Maryland, 1923) &#147;as detestable in
substance as it is crude in form&#148;.&nbsp; He predicted (wrongly) that it &#147;will
probably remain unique&#148; (<I>Wigmore on Evidence</I> (2nd ed. 1923), vol. 5, at

</SPAN>However, the world of journalism has moved on since Professor Wigmore&#146;s
day.&nbsp; The role of investigative journalism has expanded over the years to help
fill what has been described as a democratic deficit in the transparency and
accountability of our public institutions.&nbsp; The need to shine the light of
public scrutiny on the dark corners of some private institutions as well is
illustrated by Benotto J.&#146;s reference to corporate delinquencies in the list
reproduced above at para. 28.&nbsp; Professor Wigmore&#146;s&nbsp; criteria provide a workable
structure within which to assess, in light of society&#146;s evolving values, the
sometimes-competing interests of free expression and the administration of
justice and other values that promote the public interest.&nbsp; This will provide
the necessary flexibility and an opportunity for growth that is essential to
the proper function of the common law.</P>

</SPAN>There is little disagreement about the first two Wigmore criteria.&nbsp; The
media accepts that privilege can only be claimed where the communication is
made <I>explicitly</I> in exchange for a promise of confidentiality.&nbsp; Wigmore
was concerned with the confidentiality of the <I>contents</I> of the
communication itself (which is not the issue here because it was the mutual
intention of the journalist and the source to make the content of the
communication public).&nbsp;&nbsp; However,&nbsp; I think the rationale underlying the Wigmore
criteria may be applied equally to a new role, namely the maintenance of the
confidentiality of the <I>identity</I> of the source.&nbsp; Secondly, the necessity
for confidentiality is the <I>raison d&#146;&ecirc;tre</I> for the existence of the
privilege.&nbsp; If the source does not insist on confidentiality as a condition
precedent to the disclosure then no promise of confidentiality will be made and
no privilege arises.&nbsp; Journalists prefer in any event to have a source on the
record to enable their readers or listeners to evaluate its likely credibility.</P>

</SPAN>The third criterion (that the source-journalist relationship is one that
should be &#147;sedulously fostered in the public good&#148;) introduces some flexibility
in the court&#146;s evaluation of different sources and different types of
&#147;journalists&#148;.&nbsp; The relationship between the source and a blogger might be
weighed differently than in the case of a professional journalist like Mr.
McIntosh, who is subject to much greater institutional accountability within
his or her own news organization.&nbsp; These distinctions need not be canvassed in
detail here since the appellants have made out on their evidence, in my
opinion, that&nbsp; in general the relationship between professional journalists and
their secret sources is a relationship that ought to be &#147;sedulously&#148; fostered
and no persuasive reason has been offered to discount the value to the public
of the relationship between Mr. McIntosh and his source(s) in this particular
case.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>

</SPAN>The fourth Wigmore criterion does most of the work.&nbsp; Having established
the value to the public of the relationship in question, the court must weigh
against its protection any countervailing public interest such as the
investigation of a particular crime (or national security, or public safety or
some other public good).</P>

</SPAN>The appellants argue that once the first three Wigmore criteria are
established the onus should switch to the Crown (or other party seeking
disclosure) to show why, on a balance of probabilities, disclosure should be
ordered (Factum, at para. 62).&nbsp; This is particularly so in the search warrant
context, they argue, because the court is dealing with the state as a
prosecutorial antagonist and the media as a bystander to the crime.&nbsp; Indeed, in
this case, the media is in a sense the intermediate <I>victim</I> of the
alleged crime (but has made no complaint).&nbsp; The eventual intended victim was
the then Prime Minister.&nbsp; This three steps forward one step backward argument
with respect to onus is unpersuasive because it presupposes that a privilege
arises after the third step and is then subject to rebuttal by the opposing
party at the fourth step.&nbsp; However, this is not the case.&nbsp; Until the media have
met all <I>four</I> Wigmore criteria no journalistic source privilege arises.&nbsp;
The evidence is presumptively compellable and admissible.&nbsp; It is the media that
advances the proposition that the public interest in protecting its secret
source outweighs the public interest in the criminal investigation.&nbsp; The burden
of persuasion therefore lies on the media.&nbsp; That said, I expect that onus will
rarely play a pivotal role at the fourth step, where &#147;[t]he exercise is
essentially one of common sense and good judgment&#148; (<I>Ryan</I>, at para. 32).</P>

</SPAN>The weighing up will include (but of course is not restricted to) the
nature and seriousness of the offence under investigation, and the probative
value of the evidence sought to be obtained, measured against the public
interest in respecting the journalist&#146;s promise of confidentiality.&nbsp; The Crown
argues that the existence of any crime is sufficient to vitiate a privilege but
that is too broad a generalization.&nbsp; The <I>Pentagon Papers</I> case originated
in circumstances amounting to an offence, yet few would now argue that the
publication of the true facts in that situation was not in the greater public
interest.</P>

</SPAN>The underlying purpose of the investigation, as inferred from the
objective circumstances, is also relevant at the fourth stage.&nbsp; When
investigative reporting strikes at those in power it would not be unexpected
that those in power including the police may wish to strike back.&nbsp; There may be
circumstances where the criminal investigation appears to be contrived to
silence improperly the secret source, and in such cases the court may decline
to order production.&nbsp; Thus in <I>O&#146;Neill</I>, an investigation was launched
under the <I>Security of Information Act</I> to identify the secret source of a
leak to a reporter for the <I>Ottawa Citizen</I>.&nbsp; The reviewing judge,
Ratushny J. found that the RCMP sought the warrant with the intent to
intimidate the reporter into giving up her sources.&nbsp;&nbsp;  The result,&nbsp; the police
might have expected, might well have been to disincline the journalist to
publish further material on a story that was embarrassing to both the police
and to the government (para. 154).&nbsp; In such a case, the&nbsp; demand to deliver up
even physical evidence that would disclose the identity of the secret source
might well be refused.&nbsp; That is not this case.&nbsp; The alleged forgery is distinct
from whistleblowing.&nbsp; In terms of getting out the truth, the &#147;leak&#148; of a forged
document undermines rather than advances achievement of the <I>purpose</I> of
the privilege claimed by the media in the <I>public</I> interest.</P>

</SPAN>In a test of balancing the public interest in disclosure versus the
public interest in confidentiality neither the journalist nor the secret source
&#147;owns&#148; the privilege.&nbsp; Thus where a secret source decides for whatever reason
to cast aside the cloak of anonymity the public interest no longer &#147;sedulously
fosters&#148; the continuation of the confidential relationship in preference to
openness and the search for the truth.&nbsp; In such a case the journalist would
have no basis to seek to restrain the self-outing of the secret source.&nbsp; On the
other hand, where a journalist decides that the confidentiality arrangement no
longer binds (as for example, in this case, if Mr. McIntosh had concluded that
the forged bank records had been provided by the source to mislead the <I>National
Post</I> deliberately, and had thereby, in his view, forfeited its protection),
the balance would again tilt in favour of disclosure.&nbsp; The role and function of
the privilege is to facilitate the freedom of expression of the media and their
readers and listeners.&nbsp; Where the journalist concludes that the relationship in
a particular case should no longer be &#147;sedulously&#148; fostered, the substratum of
the claimed privilege is eliminated.&nbsp; The <I>public</I> interest would no
longer be served in the particular case by suppression of the identity, but of
course in the event of such disclosure, the source might have some sort of <I>private</I>
law claim for breach of contract or breach of confidence or other private
common law cause of action.&nbsp; Such private law remedies are not before us in
this appeal.</P>

</SPAN>In summary, at the fourth stage, the court will weigh up&nbsp; the evidence
on both sides (supplemented by judicial notice, common sense, good judgment and
appropriate regard for the &#147;special position of the media&#148;).&nbsp; The public
interest in free expression will <I>always</I> weigh heavily in the balance.&nbsp;
While confidential sources are not constitutionally protected, their role is
closely aligned with the role of &#147;the freedom of the press and other media of
communication&#148;, and will be valued accordingly but, to repeat, at the end of
the analysis the risk of non-persuasion rests at all four steps on the claimant
of the privilege.</P>

</SPAN>At this point it is important to remind ourselves that there is a
significant difference between&nbsp; testimonial immunity against compelled
disclosure of secret sources and the suppression by the media of relevant
physical&nbsp; evidence.&nbsp; If a client walks into a lawyer&#146;s office and leaves a
murder weapon covered with fingerprints and DNA evidence on the lawyer&#146;s desk
the law would not allow the lawyer to withhold production of the gun on the
basis of solicitor-client confidentiality, notwithstanding the thoroughgoing
protection that the law affords that relationship.&nbsp; In&nbsp; <I>R. v. Murray </I>(2000),
144 C.C.C. (3d) 289 (Ont. S.C.J.), the court affirmed this principle in the
case of a lawyer charged with suppressing sexual abuse tapes.&nbsp; Journalists,
too, have no blanket right to suppress physical evidence of a crime, even where
its production may disclose the identity of a confidential source.&nbsp; The
immunity, where it exists, is situation specific. </P>

</SPAN>After the hearing of this appeal, counsel for the appellants provided us
with a copy of the recent decision of the European Court of Human Rights in <I>Financial
Times Ltd. v. The United Kingdom</I>, [2009] ECHR 2065 (BAILII), where a
corporate plaintiff was ultimately denied access to confidential source
documents.&nbsp; In that case the plaintiff Interbrew, a Belgian brewing company,
brought civil proceedings in the United Kingdom to obtain from the media leaked
documents that, it claimed, had been doctored with false information to suggest
Interbrew was on the brink of making a takeover bid for South African
Breweries.&nbsp; The allegedly misleading information was published by the media.&nbsp;
Thereafter Interbrew suffered a drop in the value of its shares.&nbsp; Interbrew
sought production of the documents from the <I>Financial Times</I> and other
newspapers on the basis that it needed to identify the &#147;source&#148; in order to
launch a proposed civil action for breach of confidence against the person or
persons unknown.&nbsp; The English Court of Appeal upheld the disclosure order on
the ground that the &#147;relatively modest leak&#148; ([2002] EWCA Civ. 274 (BAILII), at
para. 54, leave to appeal denied, House of Lords, 9 July 2002, unreported) was
nevertheless intended to &#147;maximize the mischief&#148; (para. 55) and thus fell
within the &#147;interests of justice&#148; exception to journalistic source privilege
under the U.K. <I>Contempt of Court Act</I> <I>1981</I>.&nbsp; The European Court of
Human Rights disagreed.&nbsp; Unlike the plaintiff in the earlier case of <I>Goodwin
v. The United Kingdom</I>, judgment of 27 March 1996, <I>Reports of Judgments
and Decisions</I>, 1996-II, Interbrew had not sought an injunction in the U.K.
to prevent publication (i.e. did not avail itself of alternate means to avert
the damage).&nbsp; Interbrew had also failed to demonstrate that information about
the identity of the person who leaked the documents was unavailable from other
sources (para. 69).&nbsp; The &#147;alternate sources&#148; principle has been part of
Canadian law since <I>Re Pacific Press Ltd. and The Queen</I> (1977), 37 C.C.C.

Newspapers</I>, [2000] 3 All E.R. 257 (C.A.).&nbsp; It was not even clear in the <I>Financial

</SPAN>On the other hand in <I>Sanoma Uitgevers B.V. v. The Netherlands</I>,
E.C.H.R., judgment of 31 March 2009, Application No. 38224/03, the court upheld
the police seizure of a CD-Rom from the Dutch magazine <I>Autoweek</I> which
had photographed an illegal street race on a promise of confidentiality to the
participants.&nbsp; The court recognized the potential chilling effect of the
seizure and breach of confidentiality but said:</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:78.45pt;text-align:justify;">. . . it does not follow <I>per se</I> that the authorities are in all
such cases prevented from demanding such handover; whether this is so will
depend on the facts of the case.&nbsp; In particular, the domestic authorities are
not prevented from balancing the conflicting interests served by prosecuting
the crimes concerned against those served by the protection of journalistic
privilege; relevant considerations will include the nature and seriousness of
the crimes in question, the precise nature and content of the information
demanded, the existence of alternative possibilities of obtaining the necessary
information, and any restraints on the authorities&#146; procurement and use of the
materials concerned. . . .&nbsp; [para. 57]</P>

</SPAN>Accordingly, in my view, the Strasbourg jurisprudence is not of much
assistance to the appellants.&nbsp; Both <I>Goodwin</I> and <I>Financial Times</I>
concerned a leak to the media by corporate whistleblowers of confidential
internal documents.&nbsp; Neither involved criminal proceedings.&nbsp; Both involved
private actions in the U.K. courts where the corporate plaintiffs, in the view
of the European Court of Human Rights, had failed to demonstrate a public
interest that outweighed the public interest in free expression.&nbsp; <I>Sanoma</I>
is closer to our case.&nbsp; It is true that the European Court locates
journalist-source privilege in Article 10 of the <I>Convention</I> <I>for the
Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms</I>, 213 U.N.T.S. 221, but
that is necessarily so because the Convention is the source of its
jurisdiction.&nbsp; For the reasons already stated I would not locate
journalist-source protection in s. 2(<I>b</I>) of the <I>Charter</I> but in the
common law of privilege that is supportive of it.</P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm; ">[69]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
</SPAN>The bottom line is that no journalist can give a source a total
assurance of confidentiality.&nbsp; All such arrangements necessarily carry an
element of risk that the source&#146;s identity will eventually be revealed.&nbsp; In the
end, the extent of the risk will only become apparent when all the
circumstances in existence at the time the claim for privilege is asserted are
known and can be weighed up in the balance.&nbsp; What this means, amongst other
things, is that a source who uses anonymity to put information into the public
domain maliciously may not in the end avoid a measure of accountability.&nbsp; This
much is illustrated by recent events in the United States involving <I>New York
Times</I>&#146; reporter Judith Miller and the subsequent prosecution of her secret
source, vice-presidential aide Lewis &#147;Scooter&#148; Libby, arising out of proceedings
subsequent to his &#147;outing&#148; of CIA agent Valerie Plame:&nbsp; <I>In re Grand Jury
Subpoena, Judith Miller</I>, 397 F.3d 964 (D.C. Cir. 2005), at pp. 968-72.&nbsp; The
simplistic proposition that it is always in the public interest to maintain the
confidentiality of secret sources is belied by such events in recent
journalistic history.</P>

</SPAN>The evidence shows that the communication between Mr. McIntosh and
source Y respecting the relationship between the Prime Minister and the BDBC
originated in confidence.&nbsp; Had confidentiality not been assured the initial
information about Mr. Chr&eacute;tien&#146;s contacts with the BDBC would not have been
provided.&nbsp; Secondly, confidentiality was essential to the relationship because
without the confidentiality there would have been no disclosure and no
relationship.&nbsp; Thirdly, given the importance of investigative journalism in
exploring potential conflicts of interest in decision making at the highest
levels of government, the relationship between the appellants and their secret
sources ought in general to be &#147;sedulously fostered&#148;.&nbsp; Mr. McIntosh testified
to a belief that his source is sincere in denying involvement in any offences.&nbsp;
The transparency and accountability of government are issues of enormous public
importance.&nbsp; The disclosures related to a public controversy over the Prime
Minister&#146;s relationship to private promoters seeking loans from a federally
funded bank.&nbsp; The public ventilation of this controversy, whatever its ultimate
merits, was clearly in the public interest.&nbsp; </P>

</SPAN>Coming now to the &#147;weighing up&#148; at the fourth stage of the Wigmore
analysis, the alleged crime was described by Mr. McIntosh himself as
&#147;serious&#148;.&nbsp; Certainly, the dissemination of forged bank entries designed to
&#147;prove&#148; an egregious conflict of personal financial interest on the part of the
Prime Minister involving public funds is of sufficient seriousness to justify
amply the decision of the police to investigate the criminal allegations within
the limits of their ability and resources.&nbsp; </P>

</SPAN>The real possibility of obtaining DNA evidence or other identification
from the envelope was first raised as plausible by the source himself or
herself in conversation with Mr. McIntosh.&nbsp; This suggests that even X believed
that forensic testing could advance the investigation to his or her detriment.&nbsp;
Apart from anything else, we do not know what other evidence (if any) the
police possess or to whom they are attempting to find a DNA match. While it is
appropriate under the fourth Wigmore criterion to assess the likely probative
value of the evidence sought, the reviewing judge ought not to have pre-empted
the forensic investigation by seemingly prejudging the outcome when she wrote
that &#147;[d]isclosure of the document will minimally, if at all, advance the
investigation&#148; (para. 79) without first considering all the relevant factors in
her assessment.&nbsp; </P>

</SPAN>My colleague Abella J. shares Benotto J.&#146;s pessimism regarding the
fruitfulness of forensic analysis in this case.&nbsp; However, the reviewing judge
Benotto J. seemed to focus on fingerprint evidence and did not canvass the
merits of DNA analysis, yet DNA analysis is capable of producing results even
under exceptionally unpromising circumstances (as was shown in the exoneration
of Guy Paul Morin). It cannot be correct that the RCMP forensic lab should be
prevented from applying well-established modes of analysis to pieces of
physical evidence that have been directly linked to a serious crime simply on
the basis that in the end such analysis <I>may</I> prove to be unsuccessful.&nbsp; I
agree with the Ontario Court of Appeal that the reviewing judge&#146;s exercise of
discretion was, in these circumstances, unreasonable.</P>

</SPAN>Moreover, let us suppose that Benotto J. and my colleague Abella J. are
correct in their scepticism about the outcome of the forensic analysis, and
that the envelope is extremely unlikely to disclose the identity of Mr.
McIntosh&#146;s secret source(s).&nbsp; The court in that event would have to balance the
weak public interest in protecting an identity that is not likely to be
disclosed against the strong public interest in the production of physical
evidence of the offense.&nbsp; On this alternative view, as well, the injury that is
likely to result from disclosure does not outweigh the public interest in
correctly disposing of the criminal investigation.&nbsp; </P>

</SPAN>In her reasons Abella J. refers to the &#147;fatal disconnect between the
envelope, the documents, the identity of X and the alleged forgery&#148; (para.
134).&nbsp; This conclusion hinges on the credibility of X&#146;s story that he or she
was not the perpetrator of the forgery, but an innocent recipient, who passed
it on to Mr. McIntosh in good faith.&nbsp; I do not think the police are required to
accept as true the version of events told by X as relayed through Mr. McIntosh,
who has his own interest in the outcome of this litigation.&nbsp; The police
believe, and all three courts below accepted, that there <I>are</I> reasonable
grounds to believe that entries had been forged on the alleged bank document.&nbsp;
In my view the police need not accept X&#146;s anonymous, uncorroborated and self-exculpatory
statements as a reason to terminate their investigation of the physical
evidence any more than they need accept the disclaimers of any other potential
witness to a crime, especially when the witness may also be the perpetrator.</P>

</SPAN>I accept, of course, that the problematic transmission from X must be
assessed in light of a history of providing information and documents that
turned out to be authentic.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it appears from Corporal Gallant&#146;s
statement in a passage cited by Abella J. (para. 137), that he had no reason to
believe that what X said on this particular occasion was true.&nbsp; Nor was he
obliged to proceed on the basis that it was true.&nbsp; A denial of criminal
involvement, whether communicated directly or indirectly, is not a sufficient
ground to put an end to a serious criminal investigation, even where the
intermediate (though not the ultimate) intended victim of the alleged crime
happens to be a media organization.</P>

</SPAN>Recognizing the seriousness of the situation Mr. McIntosh says he told
the source that notwithstanding his earlier &#147;blanket, unconditional promise of
confidentiality to protect the identity of both X and Y&#148; (McIntosh Affidavit,
at para. 156), he would not now consider himself bound by that promise &#147;should
irrefutable evidence&#148; emerge that the document had been provided &#147;to
deliberately mislead me&#148; (para. 227).&nbsp; It is the courts, however, and not
individual journalists or media outlets, that must ultimately determine whether
the public interest requires disclosure.&nbsp; Mr. McIntosh&#146;s belief in the good
faith of his source cannot prevent the courts from reaching a different
conclusion. Moreover, as Laskin and Simmons JJ.A. noted, &#147;[t]he document and
the envelope are not merely pieces of evidence tending to show that a crime has
been committed.&nbsp; They are the very <I>actus reus</I> [or <I>corpus delicti</I>]
of the alleged crime&#148; (para. 115).&nbsp; In such circumstances the identity of the

</SPAN>Even where no privilege is found to exist, warrants and assistance
orders against the media must take into account their &#147;special position&#148; and be
reasonable in the &#147;totality of circumstances&#148; as required by s. 8 of the <I>Charter</I>
(&#147;Everyone has the right to be secure against unreasonable search and
seizure&#148;).&nbsp; It is not sufficient for the Crown to establish that the formal
statutory requirements of ss. 487.01 and 487.02 were met.&nbsp; Physical searches of
media premises may be highly disruptive.&nbsp; Searches may cause temporary or even
permanent suspension of print publication or broadcasting.&nbsp; Search warrant
cases like this one constitute a head-to-head clash between the government and
the media, and the media&#146;s ss. 2(<I>b</I>) and 8 interests are clearly
implicated.&nbsp; As McLachlin J. observed in her dissenting reasons in <I>Lessard</I>:</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent: 20.85pt;">The ways in which police search and seizure may
impinge on the values underlying freedom of the press are manifest. First,
searches may be physically disruptive and impede efficient and timely publication.
Second, retention of seized material by the police may delay or forestall
completing the dissemination of the news. Third, confidential sources of
information may be fearful of speaking to the press, and the press may lose
opportunities to cover various events because of fears on the part of
participants that press files will be readily available to the authorities.
Fourth, reporters may be deterred from recording and preserving their
recollections for future use. Fifth, the processing of news and its
dissemination may be chilled by the prospect that searches will disclose
internal editorial deliberations. Finally, the press may resort to
self-censorship to conceal the fact that it possesses information that may be
of interest to the police in an effort to protect its sources and its ability
to gather news in the future. All this may adversely impact on the role of the
media in furthering the search for truth, community participation and
self-fulfillment. [p. 452]</P>

</SPAN>As previously observed, <I>Lessard</I> laid down nine conditions to
provide a suitable framework to assess s. 8 reasonableness in a s. 2(<I>b</I>)
context.&nbsp; The first requirement, of course, is that the statutory prerequisites
of s. 487.01 are met.&nbsp; Here the issuing judge held, and both the reviewing judge
(Benotto J.) and the&nbsp; Court of Appeal have affirmed, that the police
established reasonable grounds to believe that criminal offences have been
committed and that information relevant to those offences will be obtained
through the use of the search warrant and the supporting assistance order.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, the appellants have raised a number of issues in addition to
journalistic-confidential source privilege which, they argue, are fatal to the
reasonableness of the general warrant and assistance order.</P>

to put their case against the warrant at the earliest reasonable opportunity,

proceed as Khawly J. did here.&nbsp; Given the broad definition of &#147;media&#148; and &#147;journalists&#148;
covered by a potential claim for privilege, the issuing judge may conclude that
an outstanding warrant will help ensure that the evidence is not made to
disappear while the merits of issuing a warrant are debated.&nbsp; An issued and
outstanding warrant may discourage such misconduct.&nbsp; There will be cases of
urgency or other circumstances supporting the need to proceed <I>ex parte</I>.&nbsp;

</SPAN>Morever, where the issuing judge does proceed <I>ex parte</I>, adequate
terms must be inserted in any warrant to protect the special position of the
media, and to permit the media ample time and opportunity to point out why, on
the facts, the warrant should be set aside.&nbsp;&nbsp; The warrant and assistance order
made by Khawly J. in this case allowed a period of a month between its issuance
and its execution to ensure the appellants&#146; ability to move to quash it before
any seizure occurred.&nbsp; This procedure allowed the appellants to assemble an
evidentiary record more ample than would have been possible on short notice.&nbsp;
The appellants took full advantage of the opportunity thus provided.&nbsp; The
record in this case fills 16 volumes.&nbsp; The review procedure lasted from the
filing of an application to quash the warrant dated July 30, 2002 until its
disposition by Benotto J. by judgment dated January 21, 2004.&nbsp; In these
circumstances I do not believe the issues of onus and deference can or should
play a significant role in the outcome, especially given the court&#146;s concern

that his decision would simply be a stepping stone to a&nbsp; constitutional battle

</SPAN>Apart from the issue of confidential sources, already dealt with, the
general warrant in this case complied with other <I>Lessard</I> conditions
designed to respect the special position of the media.&nbsp; A detailed affidavit
established that the search of a newspaper office was a necessity of last
resort, as required by <I>Re Pacific Press</I>; <I>Desc&ocirc;teaux v. Mierzwinski</I>,
[1982] 1 S.C.R. 860, and the cases that followed.&nbsp; This affirmative finding
under s. 487.01 established the grounds for the search and compelled the
appellants to invoke confidential source privilege by meeting the Wigmore test,
which they failed to do, in my opinion.&nbsp; The order of Khawly J. set out&nbsp;
conditions governing the search to ensure &#147;that the media organization would
not be unduly impeded [by a physical search] in the publishing or dissemination
of the news&#148; (<I>Lessard</I>, at p. 445).&nbsp; Perhaps most importantly, the order
contained the usual clause directing that any documents seized be sealed on

</SPAN>The appellants strongly object to the issuance of an assistance order
that directed the editor-in-chief of the <I>National Post</I> &#147;to take such
steps as are necessary&#148; to give effect to the search warrant (A.R., vol. 1, at
p. 7).&nbsp; On the evidence before Khawly J., both Mr. McIntosh and other
representatives of the <I>National Post</I> had made statements suggesting that
while the items described in the search warrant had been deliberately hidden
they were within the control of the <I>National Post</I>.&nbsp; For instance, on
December 13, 2001 counsel for the <I>National Post</I> advised Corporal Gallant
that &#147;the newspaper does not intend to deliver up to you the &#145;plain brown
envelope with no return address&#146; as referred to by Andrew McIntosh . . . at the
Toronto meeting&#148; (A.R., vol. 2, at p. 27).&nbsp; Correspondence from counsel for the
<I>National Post</I> treated the protection of the source&#146;s confidentiality as
a <I>National Post</I> issue not just a McIntosh issue (A.R., vol. 2, at pp.
27-30).&nbsp; Given the concerted action between Mr. McIntosh and his
editor-in-chief, it was entirely reasonable for the issuing judge to enlist the
assistance of the editor-in-chief in locating and producing the concealed
document.&nbsp; </P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm; ">[90]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
</SPAN>The appellants claim that the assistance order turns the editor-in-chief
into an &#147;agent of the police&#148; in the collection of evidence.&nbsp; This is overly
dramatic.&nbsp; Editors, journalists and sources do not, by reason of the important
roles they play, cease to be members of the community in which they live.&nbsp; The
claim for privilege in this case is rejected&nbsp; The editor-in-chief, as every
other member of the community, is required in the ordinary way to respect the
law.&nbsp; From the media perspective assistance orders requiring the surrender of
the document are surely preferable to a physical search of the media premises.&nbsp;
In my view, the assistance order was reasonable within the meaning of s. 8 of
the <I>Charter</I>.</P>

</SPAN>I conclude that in the facts of this case the appellants have not
established that the public interest in the protection of their secret
source(s) outweighs the public interest in the production of the physical
evidence of the alleged crimes.&nbsp; For this reason, and also because the warrant
as issued was entirely respectful of the special position of the media, I
conclude that the warrant and assistance order were properly issued and must be
complied with even if the result is to disclose the identity of the &#147;secret
source&#148; who, on the evidence, &#147;uttered&#148; a forged document.&nbsp; The appeal will
therefore be dismissed without costs.</P>

<DIV class="Section66">

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;"><SPAN style="text-transform:uppercase">LeBel J. </SPAN>&#151; </P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm; ">[93]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
</SPAN>I have read the reasons of my colleagues Binnie and Abella JJ.&nbsp; I agree
with Binnie J. that there should be no class privilege to protect
communications between journalists and their sources, and that claims of
journalist-source privilege should be resolved on a case-by-case basis applying
the Wigmore criteria. I am in particular agreement with his weighing of the
relevant rights and interests at the last stage of the Wigmore analysis.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm; ">[94]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
</SPAN>However, and with respect for the contrary view of Binnie J., I agree with
Abella J. that notice should have been given to the National Post in this case.
In my opinion, when an application for a search warrant is made, there should,
as Abella J. recommends, be a presumptive requirement of notice to the affected
media organization. While valid questions may remain as to what constitutes a
media organization for the purpose of giving notice, there can be no dispute in
the present appeal that a large news media business like the National Post
belongs to this class.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm; ">[95]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
</SPAN>Even in the most traditional format, the print media, such organizations
play a key role in disseminating information and triggering debate on public
issues. The process of applying for a search warrant should be sensitive to the
need to prevent undue or overly intrusive interference in their operations,
regardless of whether the activity in question is investigation, reporting or
commentary.&nbsp; The presumption of a notice requirement would allow media
organizations to raise their concerns at the first opportunity, thereby
precluding or minimizing unnecessary intrusions into their activities.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

</SPAN>I emphasize that this requirement should be presumptive. If the
applicant feels that notice should not be given because the situation is urgent
or because the information or documents being sought might be lost, the
application should state this and explain why the notice requirement should be
waived. It would then fall to the authorizing judge to determine whether the
requirement should in fact be waived and to craft conditions that would, so far
as possible, limit interference with the operations of the affected media
organization.</P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm; ">[97]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
</SPAN>In the circumstances of this case, however, I do not think that the lack
of notice rendered the search unreasonable. Moreover, since the authorizing
judge proceeded on the basis of established law, I would not quash the search
warrant. For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.</P>

</SPAN>The media&#146;s&nbsp; role in&nbsp; disseminating information is pivotal in its
contribution&nbsp; to public debate and thoughtful decision-making.&nbsp; Where there is
a potential impediment to the responsible performance of this role, a careful
weighing of interests must be undertaken.</P>

</SPAN>It is also undisputed that the investigation of crime is an important
public objective, and that the gathering of relevant evidence is integral to
this pursuit.&nbsp; But our justice system has always recognized that not all
evidence, however relevant, is necessarily available.&nbsp; The laws of hearsay,
informer and solicitor-client privilege,&nbsp; as well as the constitutionally
mandated exclusion of evidence under s. 24(2) of the <I>Canadian</I> <I>Charter
of Rights and Freedoms</I>, are all examples of the way the legal system is
engaged in a constant balancing of competing interests, eschewing absolutes and
mandating that in each case, a judgment must be made about which of several
significant interests should prevail.</P>

</SPAN>In this case, the state seeks to obtain evidence that is of only
questionable assistance in connection with a crime of moderate seriousness.&nbsp; It
is information that could, theoretically, identify a journalist&#146;s confidential
source, a person who may not even be in a position to provide information of
any utility whatever to the investigation.&nbsp; When both sides of the scales are
weighed in this light, there is, in my view, no contest.&nbsp; I would refuse to
order disclosure and quash both the search warrant and assistance order.&nbsp; </P>

</SPAN>In April 2001, Andrew McIntosh, an investigative reporter at the
National Post, received a sealed brown envelope with no return address.&nbsp; Inside
the envelope was a document which, Mr. McIntosh later confirmed, was sent to
him by &#147;X&#148;, a confidential source.&nbsp; X told Mr. McIntosh that the document was
received in the mail from another&nbsp; person whose identity X did not know.&nbsp; X
also said that he/she had discarded the envelope the document came in, then
mailed the document to Mr. McIntosh in a fresh envelope.</P>

</SPAN>The document appeared to be a copy of a loan authorization prepared by
the Business Development Bank of Canada in connection with a loan application
by a hotel in Quebec, the Auberge Grand-M&egrave;re.&nbsp; One of the document&#146;s footnotes
included a debt to &#147;JAC Consultants&#148;, a Chr&eacute;tien family investment company.</P>

</SPAN>Mr. McIntosh had taken an interest in the relationship between the then
Prime Minister and the owner of the Auberge in the late 1990s. He wrote several
articles about it in the National Post, relying heavily on confidential sources
whose information he was able to authenticate.</P>

</SPAN>Mr. McIntosh contacted both the Prime Minister&#146;s office and the Bank to
verify the latest document.&nbsp; Both said the document was a forgery, and the Bank
complained to the RCMP about it.&nbsp; This launched an investigation into the
forgery claim.&nbsp; At a meeting with Mr. McIntosh and senior National Post
personnel on June 7, 2001, the RCMP, through Corporal Roland Gallant, asked for
the document and the envelope it came in. <B>&nbsp;</B>Corporal Gallant also asked
for the identity of the sender.&nbsp; These requests were refused.</P>

</SPAN>Without notice to the National Post or Mr. McIntosh, Corporal Gallant
obtained a search warrant and an<B> </B>assistance order.&nbsp; Both were quashed by
Benotto J. ((2004), 69 O.R. (3d) 427), but were subsequently reinstated by the
Ontario Court of Appeal (2008 ONCA 139, 89 O.R. (3d) 1).</P>

</SPAN>Its inherent complexity is perhaps best exposed by the opinions in <I>Branzburg
v. Hayes</I>, 408 U.S. 665 (1972).&nbsp; In this landmark decision, the Supreme
Court of the United States dealt with journalist-source privilege for the first
time, refusing to recognize any constitutional or common law privilege that
would allow a reporter to refuse to reveal confidential information to a grand
jury.&nbsp; The grand jury in the United States reviews all relevant evidence to
determine whether someone should be charged with a crime and, accordingly, has
broad investigatory powers.</P>

protecting the ability to investigate crime over protecting the media (p.

advocating a more nuanced approach that would require the examination of each
case on its own merits (pp. 709-10).&nbsp; </P>

</SPAN>This international perspective leads me to agree with Binnie J. that&nbsp;
journalist-source privilege should be assessed on a case-by-case basis.&nbsp; I
accept the criticism that this approach can create some imprecision, but judges
rarely have the luxury of applying absolute rules and adjudicate of necessity
in fields of law bounded by designated borders within which discretion is exercised
based on the particular circumstances of the case.&nbsp; In other words, balancing
competing interests, with all its inherent nuance and imprecision, is a core

confidential sources generally in the responsible performance of the media&#146;s

</SPAN>In the United States, approximately three dozen states have enacted
press &#147;shield laws&#148; protecting the relationship between a news reporter and his
or her source.&nbsp; All but one of the remaining states judicially recognize some
form of journalist-source privilege.&nbsp; While the scope of the protection varies
from state to state, most of these protective laws offer some form of qualified
privilege to reporters consistent with the three-part test suggested by Stewart
J. in <I>Branzburg</I>, that is, source information is protected unless the
party seeking disclosure can establish that (i) the information is relevant;
(ii) the information is unavailable through other sources; and (iii) a
compelling public interest exists for the disclosure of the information (CRS

(the <I>Free Flow of Information Act of 2009</I>, H.R. 985) was passed by the

stressing the importance of protecting confidential sources in their ability to
gather and report the news.&nbsp; Peter Desbarats, former Dean of the Graduate
School of Journalism at the University of Western Ontario, stressed the
importance of such sources to &#147;investigative journalists&nbsp; [in seeking] to serve
the public interest by bringing to public attention matters that people in
authority are less than anxious to have subjected to public scrutiny&#148;.&nbsp; In his

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent: 20.85pt;">Given my experience in the world of journalism, it is
my opinion that the interests of a free press require the court to recognize
the special relationship between a journalist and a confidential source who has
been given a promise of secrecy.&nbsp; The giving of promises of secrecy is
essential to a free and vigorous press, which in turn is essential to ensuring
a well informed citizenry and a vibrant democracy.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">As Mr. McIntosh himself stated in his affidavit, echoing the experiences
expressed by other journalists in the various affidavits submitted in these
proceedings:</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify">. . .
sometimes a source will share either confidential information and/or documents
with me for use in a story on the explicit condition that under no
circumstances is their identity as the source of the information or documents
ever to be publicly disclosed to anyone, particularly in the event of a legal
proceeding, public hearing or official inquiry of any kind that may result from
the publication of the subsequent story. ...</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;">. . .&nbsp; my effectiveness as an investigative reporter would be seriously
impaired because key sources would no longer trust me to keep their identities
confidential, thereby preventing me from getting the sensitive information I
need to do my job and reveal matters of public interest that might otherwise
remain unknown to the Canadian public.</P>

connection with this latest document by asking for an affidavit from him/her:</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;">I asked X whether he/she would be prepared to swear a confidential
affidavit confirming that he/she did not alter or forge the loan authorization
document.&nbsp; I used this approach to test X&#146;s integrity.&nbsp; As X agreed without
hesitation to swear such an affidavit, I did not proceed further with this
request.</P>

</SPAN>And to protect his own integrity, Mr. McIntosh told X that he would only
protect his/her confidentiality if he were satisfied that he was not being
misled:</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent: 20.85pt">I stated to Confidential Source X that as long as I believed that
he/she had not provided the document to deliberately mislead me, my undertaking
of confidentiality would remain binding.&nbsp; I also told Confidential Source X
that should irrefutable evidence to the contrary emerge, our agreement of
confidentiality would become null and void.&nbsp; X agreed to these terms. </P>

</SPAN>Given Mr. McIntosh&#146;s reputation, it strikes me as counterintuitive to
conclude that he would protect the identity of a source whom he suspects of <I>knowingly</I>
providing him with false information.&nbsp; Mr. McIntosh should not be taken to have
intended to risk his reputation or his livelihood so easily.</P>

</SPAN>Corporal Gallant said that he wanted the loan authorization document as

the identity of the source of the alleged forgery.&nbsp; As he said in his Information
to Obtain:</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent: 20.85pt;">The brown envelope that contained the documents and
that was received by the National Post can contain information.&nbsp; I wish to
submit it for forensic examination to determine whether it, or the false
document, has fingerprints or other identifying markings which might assist in
identifying the source of the document.&nbsp; As the forged object it will be
required as evidence to substantiate any charge arising out of this
investigation.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm; ">[133]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</SPAN>Corporal Gallant had consulted a document examiner at the RCMP Central
Forensic Laboratory in Ottawa to determine what forms of evidence an
examination of the materials could yield:</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent: 20.85pt">She&nbsp; . . . confirmed for me that <U>it may be possible</U> to acquire
biological material (saliva) left on a stamp or seal of an envelope, if the
person placing the stamp or closing the seal licked the stamp/seal to engage
the adhesive. Finally, she confirmed that <U>it may be possible</U> to
fingerprint the documents to identify who had handled them. [Emphasis added.]</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm; ">[134]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</SPAN>At best, then, &#147;it may be possible&#148; to acquire identifying information.&nbsp;
Based on the record, however, there is a fatal disconnect between the envelope,
the documents, the identity of X and the alleged forgery, regardless of the
fruits of the forensic testing.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

</SPAN>As previously noted, X told Mr. McIntosh that he/she received the
document anonymously in the mail, had discarded the envelope, and forwarded the
document to Mr. McIntosh in a different envelope.&nbsp; It also appears from the
record that X did not know the document might be a forgery when it was sent to
Mr. McIntosh. Since X did not know the identity of the person from whom he/she
had received the document, learning X&#146;s identity would yield virtually no
evidence that could assist in determining who was responsible for the alleged
forgery.</P>

</SPAN>Secondly, Corporal Gallant said in cross-examination that &#147;[t]he more
documents are manipulated, the least likely the chances of getting fingerprints
off of it&#148;, and acknowledged that there was a &#147;far more remote and speculative
possibility that that same document [had] the prints of the forger&#148;.&nbsp; Both the
document and the envelope had been extensively handled.&nbsp; Mr. McIntosh took the
document and envelope with him from Ottawa to Toronto, where they were handled
by the lawyer for the National Post, the editor-in-chief and the deputy
editor.&nbsp; It is therefore possible that even forensic testing, including DNA
testing of the materials, would not be of any assistance in identifying the
alleged forger.</P>

</SPAN>And this brings us to another factor limiting the benefit to the
criminal investigation of learning X&#146;s identity.&nbsp; On cross-examination,
Corporal Gallant explained that he wanted to learn X&#146;s identity because he
wanted to question X about X&#146;s source, whose identity, it should be remembered,
was unknown to X:</P>

since the evidence is that X received the document from an anonymous source
whose identity he/she did not know, and since the envelope in which X received
the document is not the envelope in the National Post&#146;s possession, the benefit
<I>to the forgery investigation</I> of getting the documents is, at best,
marginal.&nbsp; Based on all of this, it seems to me to be clear that X is in no position
to provide any information of assistance in the investigation of the alleged
forgery, even if he/she agreed to be questioned by the police.</P>

</SPAN>The only possible evidence the envelope could yield, and that only
remotely, is the identity of X, not of the alleged forger.&nbsp; This would mean
that the only purpose for learning the confidential source&#146;s identity is to
discover who had created this public and awkward controversy.&nbsp; Corporal
Gallant&#146;s Information to Obtain appears to confirm this purpose when he says:</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;">. . . this investigation seeks to determine the identify [<I>sic</I>] of
someone who has maliciously attempted to mislead the press with a view to the
publication of false information.&nbsp; It is not intended to identify a person
providing truthful information to a news outlet.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">Curiosity about
the identity of a confidential source may be understandable, but is never, by
itself, an acceptable basis for interfering with freedom of the press (<I>O&#146;Neill
v. Canada (Attorney General)</I> (2006), 213 C.C.C. (3d) 389 (S.C.J.)).</P>

</SPAN>And that brings us to consider the seriousness of the crime at issue in
this case, a factor that seems to me to be relevant in balancing the competing
interests.&nbsp; As Professor Gora argues:</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;">Have we solved or deterred important crimes that would not have been
otherwise interdicted by law enforcement?&nbsp; Have journalists ever provided the
smoking gun to help catch a killer or a terrorist, or just a leaker? . . .&nbsp; Has
the gain to law enforcement been worth the loss to the First Amendment?&nbsp; A
proper respect for the First Amendment requires that we at least ask these
questions. [pp. 1420-21]</P>

<DIV class="Section84">

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">We must remember
that what we are dealing with here is an alleged forgery. On a continuum of
serious criminality, it strikes me as unhelpful to compare a possible forgery
of a possible debt, as in our case, with the Paul Bernardo murder scenario the
majority&#146;s reasons invoke by relying on <I>R. v. Murray </I>(2000), 144 C.C.C.
(3d) 289 (Ont. S.C.J.).&nbsp; The remote possibility of resolving the debt forgery
is far from sufficiently significant to outweigh the public benefit in
protecting a rigorously thorough and responsible press.</P>

</SPAN>So on one side of the balance we have the slightest possible benefit to
an investigation of an alleged forgery, and on the other we have the far
weightier injury to the press interests at stake in revealing X&#146;s identity.&nbsp;
Even if there is only a remote prospect of being able to identify X from the
documents, the remoteness of this possibility hardly argues for disclosure, as
the majority suggests.&nbsp; There may be no consequential harm to X, but neither
will there be any consequential benefit to the investigation.&nbsp; This means that
the harm and benefit of disclosure <I>in this particular case</I> is
speculative at best.&nbsp; The major demonstrable harm, with no countervailing
benefit, is to the ability of the press to carry out its public mandate. </P>

sought against it.&nbsp; A search warrant of media premises is a particularly
serious intrusion, and a decision should not be made about its propriety

requested notification of the application, but he decided to proceed without
notice.&nbsp; This is regrettable, since there were serious informational gaps in
the Information to Obtain that were substantially narrowed by the&nbsp; National

should therefore contain the appropriate information, including whether
alternative sources for obtaining the information sought by the warrant had
been reasonably investigated and exhausted (<I>Lessard</I>, at p. 445; see also

</SPAN>Nor did Corporal Gallant inquire into whether any other members of
Parliament or other media outlets may have received the document:</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:78.45pt;text-align:justify;text-indent: -20.85pt">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;  . . . did you make inquiries of the other political parties,
such as the Conservative party and the Alliance party, because they clearly
were reviewing the document?&nbsp; Did you make such inquiries before you got the
search warrants in this case?</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:324.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent: -266.4pt;">A&nbsp;&nbsp;  At this time, no, Your Honour.&nbsp; I have not
started anything with respect to political parties, whether it be the PC or the
Alliance.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  </P>

<P class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;">. .
. </P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:78.45pt;text-align:justify;text-indent: -20.85pt">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;  And just to complete this area, I also understand that you made
no inquiries of other major media outlets like the Canadian Broadcasting
Corporation or The Globe and Mail, to see whether they received such a
document?</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:78.45pt;text-align:justify;text-indent: -20.85pt;">A&nbsp;&nbsp;  No.&nbsp; That&#146;s correct, Your Honour.&nbsp; The
complaint we got here at the RCMP related to The National Post, and we have not
directed our attention to other media organizations.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm; ">[152]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</SPAN>And&nbsp; although the information he gave in the Information to Obtain was
that there was no outstanding debt from the Auberge to JAC Consultants, Corporal
Gallant admitted on cross-examination that he had not examined the books of JAC
Consultants prior to filing his request for the search warrant.&nbsp; This was of
some significance because the cross-examination also revealed that there were
problems with some of the corroborating documents provided by the Bank.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm; ">[153]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</SPAN>The original suppliers&#146; list that the Bank gave to Corporal Gallant,
which he had reviewed at the start of the investigation, was missing the page
where, alphabetically, &#147;JAC Consultants&#148; would have appeared.&nbsp; The Bank
requested and received a new suppliers&#146; list from the accountant for the owner
of the Auberge, which did not show any debt to JAC Consultants.&nbsp; Through the
cross-examination of Corporal Gallant, it was revealed that these two lists had
different dates on them, and that they differed in some of the supplier names
and amounts.&nbsp; By itself, this information might not have made a difference in
the outcome, but when blended with the other missing pieces in the Information
to Obtain, it arguably assumes some potential relevance.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm; ">[154]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</SPAN>But the most notable fact missing from the narrative that was revealed
by the cross-examination of Corporal Gallant, was that the document came from a
confidential source:</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:78.45pt;text-align:justify;text-indent: -20.85pt">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;  From your perspective, did you or did you not believe it was
important to tell the judge that the material you sought may have emanated from
a confidential source?</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:78.45pt;text-align:justify;text-indent: -20.85pt;">A&nbsp;&nbsp;  Well, the information I had at the time ... was
that the documents we were seeking came from an anonymous source.&nbsp; It was not
described to us as a confidential source.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">Counsel for the
National Post then drew Corporal Gallant&#146;s attention to a letter he had
received prior to seeking the warrant, in which the National Post had voiced
its concern that what was being sought emanated from a confidential source:</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:78.45pt;text-align:justify;text-indent: -20.85pt">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;  And I take it, sir, that at no time did you draw, especially to
the Justice of the Peace, that the document and envelope that you sought from
the Post&#146;s perspective emanated from a confidential source? You did not draw
that to his attention?&nbsp; Beyond putting this letter in the appendix?</P>

</DIV>

<SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><BR clear="all" style="page-break-before:auto">
</SPAN>

<DIV class="Section89">

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:78.45pt;text-align:justify;text-indent: -20.85pt;">A&nbsp;&nbsp;  No.&nbsp; That is not included in the search warrant
...&nbsp; except for the fact that it&#146;s written here.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">This
information, if disclosed, would logically have led to an inquiry into whether
the confidentiality of the source ought to be protected.&nbsp; </P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm; ">[155]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</SPAN>It seems logical to me that given the inherent legal complexities in
authorizing a search warrant against the media, any problems with the
Information to Obtain should be canvassed <I>prior</I> to deciding whether to
issue the warrant.&nbsp; The National Post lost the opportunity to make <I>timely </I>submissions
not only on the confidential nature of the source, but also about the deficiencies
in the information.&nbsp; Taken together, the information elicited through
cross-examination might well have resulted in the search warrant not being
issued at all.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm; ">[156]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</SPAN>The media will always be in the best position to provide relevant
information about the particular context, including whether a confidential
relationship is at stake.&nbsp; As a general rule, therefore, it is entitled to
notice of a request for a search warrant unless there are exceptional and
urgent circumstances justifying an <I>ex parte</I> hearing.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm; ">[157]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</SPAN>Here there were no such circumstances.&nbsp; The Bank complained to the RCMP
about the forgery by telephone on April 7, 2001, and formally complained by
letter on April 11, 2001.&nbsp; Mr. McIntosh was interviewed on June 7, 2001, and
the search warrant was issued over a year later on July 4, 2002.&nbsp; Clearly there
was ample time for the National Post to receive notice of the application for a
search warrant, to cross-examine Corporal Gallant, and to make its submissions.</P>

</SPAN>The Crown argued that the one-month delay between the granting of the
search warrant and its execution gave the National Post time to respond to the
issuance of the warrant with a <I>certiorari </I>application.&nbsp; This, with
respect, is an untimely &#151; and needless &#151; public expense.&nbsp; The National Post
should have had the opportunity to make its submissions <I>before</I> the
warrant was issued.&nbsp; </P>
