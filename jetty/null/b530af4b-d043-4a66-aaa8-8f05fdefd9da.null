<DIV class="Section4">

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">The Province of British Columbia issued a request for
expression of interest (&#147;RFEI&#148;) for the design and construction of a highway.&nbsp;
Six teams responded with submissions including Tercon and Brentwood.&nbsp; A few
months later, the Province informed the six proponents that it now intended to
design the highway itself and issued a request for proposals (&#147;RFP&#148;) for its
construction.&nbsp; The RFP set out a specifically defined project and contemplated
that proposals would be evaluated according to specific criteria.&nbsp; Under its
terms, only the six original proponents were eligible to submit a proposal;
those received from any other party would not be considered.&nbsp; The RFP also
included an exclusion of liability clause which provided:&nbsp; &#147;Except as expressly
and specifically permitted in these Instructions to Proponents, no Proponent
shall have any claim for any compensation of any kind whatsoever, as a result
of participating in this RFP, and by submitting a proposal each proponent shall
be deemed to have agreed that it has no claim.&#148;&nbsp; As it lacked expertise in
drilling and blasting, Brentwood entered into a pre&#8209;bidding agreement
with another construction company (&#147;EAC&#148;), which was not a qualified bidder, to
undertake the work as a joint venture.&nbsp; This arrangement allowed Brentwood to
prepare a more competitive proposal.&nbsp; Ultimately, Brentwood submitted a bid in
its own name with EAC listed as a &#147;major member&#148; of the team.&nbsp; Brentwood and
Tercon were the two short&#8209;listed proponents and the Province selected
Brentwood for the project.&nbsp; Tercon successfully brought an action in damages
against the Province.&nbsp; The trial judge found that the Brentwood bid was, in
fact, submitted by a joint venture of Brentwood and EAC and that the Province,
which was aware of the situation, breached the express provisions of the
tendering contract with Tercon by considering a bid from an ineligible bidder
and by awarding it the work.&nbsp; She also held that, as a matter of construction,
the exclusion clause did not bar recovery for the breaches she had found.&nbsp; The
clause was ambiguous and she resolved this ambiguity in Tercon&#146;s favour.&nbsp; She
held that the Province&#146;s breach was fundamental and that it was not fair or
reasonable to enforce the exclusion clause in light of the Province&#146;s breach.&nbsp;
The Court of Appeal set aside the decision, holding that the exclusion clause
was clear and unambiguous and barred compensation for all defaults.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;"><I>Held</I> (McLachlin&nbsp;C.J.
and Binnie, Abella and Rothstein&nbsp;JJ. dissenting):&nbsp; The appeal should be

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;"><I>Per</I> McLachlin&nbsp;C.J.
and <B>Binnie</B>, LeBel, Deschamps, Fish, Abella, Charron, Rothstein and
Cromwell&nbsp;JJ.:&nbsp; With respect to the appropriate framework of analysis the
doctrine of fundamental breach should be &#147;laid to rest&#148;.&nbsp; The following
analysis should be applied when a plaintiff seeks to escape the effect of an
exclusion clause or other contractual terms to which it had previously agreed.&nbsp;
The first issue is whether, as a matter of interpretation, the exclusion clause
even applies to the circumstances established in evidence.&nbsp; This will depend on
the court&#146;s interpretation of the intention of the parties as expressed in the
contract.&nbsp; If the exclusion clause applies, the second issue is whether the
exclusion clause was unconscionable and thus invalid at the time the contract
was made.&nbsp; If the exclusion clause is held to be valid at the time of contract
formation and applicable to the facts of the case, a third enquiry may be
raised as to whether the court should nevertheless refuse to enforce the
exclusion clause because of an overriding public policy.&nbsp; The burden of
persuasion lies on the party seeking to avoid enforcement of the clause to
demonstrate an abuse of the freedom of contract that outweighs the very strong
public interest in their enforcement.&nbsp; Conduct approaching serious criminality
or egregious fraud are but examples of well&#8209;accepted considerations of
public policy that are substantially incontestable and may override the public
policy of freedom to contract and disable the defendant from relying upon the
exclusion clause.&nbsp; Despite agreement on the appropriate framework of analysis
the court divided on the applicability of the exclusion clause to the facts of
this case as set out below.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;"><I>Per</I> LeBel, Deschamps,
Fish, Charron and <B>Cromwell</B>&nbsp;JJ.:&nbsp; The Province breached the express
provisions of the tendering contract with Tercon by accepting a bid from a
party who should not even have been permitted to participate in the tender
process and by ultimately awarding the work to that ineligible bidder.&nbsp; This
egregious conduct by the Province also breached the implied duty of fairness to
bidders.&nbsp; The exclusion clause, which barred claims for compensation &#147;as a
result of participating&#148; in the tendering process, did not, when properly
interpreted, exclude Tercon&#146;s claim for damages.&nbsp; By considering a bid from an
ineligible bidder, the Province not only acted in a way that breached the
express and implied terms of the contract, it did so in a manner that was an
affront to the integrity and business efficacy of the tendering process.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">Submitting a compliant bid in response to a tender call
may give rise to &quot;Contract A&quot; between the bidder and the owner.&nbsp;
Whether a Contract A arises and what its terms are depends on the express and
implied terms and conditions of the tender call and the legal consequences of
the parties&#146; actual dealings in each case.&nbsp; Here, there is no basis to
interfere with the trial judge&#146;s findings that there was an intent to create
contractual obligations upon submission of a compliant bid and that only the
six original proponents that qualified through the RFEI process were eligible
to submit a response to the RFP.&nbsp; The tender documents and the required
ministerial approval of the process stated expressly that the Province was
contractually bound to accept bids only from eligible bidders.&nbsp; Contract A
therefore could not arise by the submission of a bid from any other party.&nbsp; The
trial judge found that the joint venture of Brentwood and EAC was not eligible
to bid as they had not simply changed the composition of their team but, in
effect, had created a new bidder.&nbsp; The Province fully understood this and would
not consider a bid from or award the work to that joint venture.&nbsp; The trial
judge did not err in finding that in fact, if not in form, Brentwood&#146;s bid was
on behalf of a joint venture between itself and EAC.&nbsp; The joint venture
provided Brentwood with a competitive advantage in the bidding process and was
a material consideration in favour of the Brentwood bid during the Province&#146;s
evaluation process.&nbsp; Moreover, the Province took active steps to obfuscate the
reality of the true nature of the Brentwood bid.&nbsp; The bid by the joint venture
constituted &#147;material non&#8209;compliance&#148; with the tendering contract and
breached both the express eligibility provisions of the tender documents, and
the implied duty to act fairly towards all bidders.</P>

<DIV class="Section7">

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">When the exclusion clause is interpreted in harmony with
the rest of the RFP and in light of the commercial context of the tendering
process, it did not exclude a damages claim resulting from the Province
unfairly permitting an ineligible bidder to participate in the tendering
process.&nbsp; The closed list of bidders was the foundation of this RFP and the
parties should, at the very least, be confident that their initial bids will
not be skewed by some underlying advantage in the drafting of the call for
tenders conferred only upon one potential bidder.&nbsp; The requirement that only
compliant bids be considered and the implied obligation to treat bidders fairly
are factors that contribute to the integrity and business efficacy of the
tendering process.&nbsp; The parties did not intend, through the words found in this
exclusion clause, to waive compensation for conduct, like that of the Province
in this case, that strikes at the heart of the tendering process.&nbsp; Clear
language would be necessary to exclude liability for breach of the implied
obligation, particularly in the case of public procurement where transparency
is essential.&nbsp; Furthermore, the restriction on eligibility of bidders was a key
element of the alternative process approved by the Minister.&nbsp; When the
statutory provisions which governed the tendering process in this case are
considered, it seems unlikely that the parties intended through this exclusion
clause to effectively gut a key aspect of the approved process.&nbsp; The text of
the exclusion clause in the RFP addresses claims that result from
&#147;participating in this RFP&#148;.&nbsp; Central to &#147;participating in this RFP&#148; was
participating in a contest among those eligible to participate.&nbsp; A process
involving other bidders &#151; the process followed by the Province &#151; is not the
process called for by &#147;this RFP&#148; and being part of that other process is not in
any meaningful sense &#147;participating in this RFP&#148;.</P>

McLachlin&nbsp;C.J.and <B>Binnie</B>, Abella and Rothstein&nbsp;JJ.
(dissenting):&nbsp; The Ministry&#146;s conduct, while in breach of its contractual
obligations, fell within the terms of the exclusion compensation clause.&nbsp; The
clause is clear and unambiguous and no legal ground or rule of law permits a
court to override the freedom of the parties to contract with respect to this
particular term, or to relieve Tercon against its operation in this case.&nbsp; A
court has no discretion to refuse to enforce a valid and applicable contractual
term unless the plaintiff can point to some paramount consideration of public
policy sufficient to override the public interest in freedom of contact and
defeat what would otherwise be the contractual rights of the parties.&nbsp; The
public interest in the transparency and integrity of the government tendering
process, while important, did not render unenforceable the terms of the
contract Tercon agreed to.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">Brentwood was a legitimate competitor in the RFP process
and all bidders knew that the road contract would not be performed by the
proponent alone and required a large &#147;team&#148; of different trades and personnel
to perform.&nbsp; The issue was whether EAC would be on the job as a major sub&#8209;contractor
or identified with Brentwood as a joint venture &#147;proponent&#148; with EAC.&nbsp; Tercon
has legitimate reason to complain about the Ministry&#146;s conduct, but its
misconduct did not rise to the level where public policy would justify the
court in depriving the Ministry of the protection of the exclusion of
compensation clause freely agreed to by Tercon in the contract.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">Contract A is based not on some abstract externally
imposed rule of law but on the presumed (and occasionally implied) intent of
the parties.&nbsp; At issue is the intention of the <I>actual </I>parties not what
the court may project in hindsight would have been the intention of <I>reasonable
</I>parties.&nbsp; Only in rare circumstances will a court relieve a party from the
bargain it has made.</P>

<DIV class="Section9">

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">The exclusion clause did not run afoul of the statutory
requirements.&nbsp; While the <I>Ministry of Highway and Transportation Act </I>favours
&#147;the integrity of the tendering process&#148;, it nowhere prohibits the parties from
negotiating a &#147;no claims&#148; clause as part of their commercial agreement and
cannot plausibly be interpreted to have that effect.&nbsp; Tercon &#151; a sophisticated
and experienced contractor &#151; chose to bid on the project, including the risk
posed by an exclusion of compensation clause, on the terms proposed by the
Ministry.&nbsp; That was its prerogative and nothing in the &#147;policy of the Act&#148;
barred the parties&#146; agreement on that point.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">The trial judge found that Contract A was breached when
the RFP process was not conducted by the Ministry with the degree of fairness
and transparency that the terms of Contract A entitled Tercon to expect.&nbsp; The
Ministry was at fault in its performance of the RFP, but the process did not
thereby cease to be the RFP process in which Tercon had elected to participate.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">The interpretation of the majority on this point is
disagreed with.&nbsp; &#147;Participating in this RFP&#148; began with &#147;submitting a proposal&#148;
for consideration.&nbsp; The RFP process consisted of more than the final selection
of the winning bid and Tercon participated in it.&nbsp; Tercon&#146;s bid was
considered.&nbsp; To deny that such participation occurred on the ground that in the
end the Ministry chose a Brentwood joint venture (an ineligible bidder) instead
of Brentwood itself (an eligible bidder) would be to give the clause a strained
and artificial interpretation in order, indirectly and obliquely, to avoid the
impact of what may seem to the majority <I>ex post facto </I>to have been an
unfair and unreasonable clause.</P>

<DIV class="Section10">

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">Moreover, the exclusion clause was not unconscionable.&nbsp;
While the Ministry and Tercon do not exercise the same level of power and
authority, Tercon is a major contractor and is well able to look after itself
in a commercial context so there is no relevant imbalance of bargaining power.&nbsp;
Further, the clause is not as draconian as Tercon portrays it.&nbsp; Other remedies
for breach of Contract A were available.&nbsp; The parties expected, even if they
did not like it, that the &#147;no claims&#148; clause would operate even where the
eligibility criteria in respect of the bid (including the bidder) were not
complied with.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">Finally, the Ministry&#146;s misconduct did not rise to the
level where public policy would justify the court in depriving the Ministry of
the protection of the exclusion of compensation clause freely agreed to by
Tercon in the contract.</P>

</SPAN>The Province accepted a bid from a bidder who was not eligible to
participate in the tender and then took steps to ensure that this fact was not
disclosed. The main question on appeal, as I see it, is whether the Province
succeeded in excluding its liability for damages flowing from this conduct
through an exclusion clause it inserted into the contract.&nbsp; I share the view of
the trial judge that it did not.</P>

</SPAN>The appeal arises out of&nbsp; a tendering contract between the
appellant, Tercon Contractors Ltd., who was the bidder,&nbsp; and the respondent,
Her Majesty the Queen in Right of the Province of British Columbia, who issued
the tender call.&nbsp; The case turns on the interpretation of provisions in the
contract relating to eligibility to bid and&nbsp; exclusion of compensation
resulting from participation in the tendering process. </P>

</SPAN>The trial judge found that the respondent (which I will refer to
as the Province) breached the express provisions of the&nbsp; tendering contract
with&nbsp; Tercon&nbsp; by accepting a bid from another party who was not eligible to bid
and by ultimately awarding the work to that ineligible bidder.&nbsp; In short, a bid
was accepted and the work&nbsp; awarded to a party who should not even have been
permitted to participate in the tender process. The judge also found that this
and related conduct by the Province breached the implied duty of fairness to
bidders, holding that the Province had acted &#147;egregiously&#148; (2006 BCSC 499, 53
B.C.L.R (4th) 138, at para. 150).&nbsp; The judge then turned to the Province&#146;s defence
based on an exclusion clause that barred claims for compensation &#147;as a result
of participating &#148; in the tendering process.&nbsp; She held that this clause,
properly interpreted, did not exclude Tercon&#146;s claim for damages.&nbsp; In effect,
she held that it was not within the contemplation of the parties that this
clause would bar a remedy in damages arising from the Province&#146;s unfair
dealings with a party who was not entitled to participate in the tender in the
first place.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm; ">[4]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
</SPAN>The Province appealed and the Court of Appeal reversed (2007 BCCA
592, 73 B.C.L.R. (4th) 201).&nbsp; Dealing only with the exclusion clause issue, it
held that the clause was&nbsp; clear and unambiguous and barred compensation for all
defaults.&nbsp; </P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm; ">[5]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
</SPAN>On Tercon&#146;s appeal to this Court, the&nbsp; questions&nbsp; for us are
whether the successful bidder was eligible to participate in the request for
proposals (&#147;RFP&#148;) and, if not, whether&nbsp; Tercon&#146;s claim for damages is barred by
the exclusion clause.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm; ">[6]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
</SPAN>In my respectful view, the trial judge reached the right result
on both issues.&nbsp; The Province&#146;s attempts to persuade us that it did not breach
the tendering contract are, in my view, wholly unsuccessful.&nbsp; The foundation of
the tendering contract was that only six, pre-selected bidders would be
permitted to participate in the bidding.&nbsp; As the trial judge held, the Province
not only acted in a way that breached the express and implied terms of the
contract by considering a bid from an ineligible bidder, it did so in a manner
that was an affront to the integrity and business efficacy of the tendering
process. One must not lose sight of the fact that the trial judge found that
the Province acted egregiously by &#147;ensuring that [the true bidder] was not
disclosed&#148; (para. 150) and that its breach &#147;attacke[d] the underlying premise of
the [tendering] process&#148; (para. 146), a process which was set out in detail in
the contract and, in addition, had been given ministerial approval as required
by statute. </P>

</SPAN>As for its reliance on the exclusion clause, the Province submits
that the parties were free to agree to limitations of liability and did so.&nbsp;
Consideration of this submission requires an interpretation of the words of the
clause to which the parties agreed in the context of the contract as a whole.
My view is that, properly interpreted, the exclusion clause does not protect
the Province from Tercon&#146;s damage claim which arises from the Province&#146;s
dealings with a party not even eligible to bid, let alone from its breach of
the implied duty of fairness to bidders.&nbsp; In other words, the Province&#146;s
liability did not arise from Tercon&#146;s participation in the process that the
Province established, but from the Province&#146;s unfair dealings with a party who
was not entitled to participate in that process. </P>

Overview of the Facts</U></P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm; ">[9]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
</SPAN>I will have to set out more factual detail as part of my
analysis.&nbsp; For now, a very brief summary will suffice.&nbsp; In 2000, the Ministry
of Transportation and Highways (the &#147;Province&#148;) issued a request for
expressions of interest (&#147;RFEI&#148;) for designing and building a highway in
northwestern British Columbia.&nbsp; Six teams made submissions, including Tercon
and Brentwood Enterprises Ltd.&nbsp; Later that year, the Province&nbsp; informed the six
proponents that it now intended to design the highway itself and would issue a
RFP for its construction.&nbsp; </P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm; ">[10]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
</SPAN>The RFP was formally issued on January 15, 2001.&nbsp; Under its
terms, only the six original proponents were eligible to submit a proposal.&nbsp;
The RFP also included a clause excluding all claims for damages &#147;as a result of
participating in this RFP&#148; (s.&nbsp; 2:10).</P>

</SPAN>Unable to submit a competitive bid on its own, Brentwood teamed
up with Emil Anderson Construction Co. (&#147;EAC&#148;), which was not a qualified
bidder, and together they submitted a bid in Brentwood&#146;s name.&nbsp;&nbsp; Brentwood and
Tercon were the two short-listed proponents and the Ministry ultimately
selected Brentwood as the preferred proponent.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm; ">[12]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
</SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;Tercon brought an action seeking damages, alleging that the
Ministry had considered and accepted an ineligible bid and that but for that
breach, it would have been awarded the contract.&nbsp; The trial judge agreed and
awarded roughly $3.5 million in damages and prejudgment interest.&nbsp; As noted,
the Court of Appeal reversed and Tercon appeals by leave of the Court. </P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">1.&nbsp;&nbsp; the Province breached the tendering contract by entertaining a bid

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">2.&nbsp;&nbsp; the exclusion clause does not bar the appellant&#146;s claim for damages

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">A.<I>&nbsp; Was the

</SPAN>The first issue is whether the Brentwood bid was from an eligible
bidder.&nbsp; The judge found that the bid was in substance, although not in form,
from a joint venture of Brentwood and EAC and that it was, therefore, an ineligible
bid. The Province attacks this finding on&nbsp; three grounds:</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;">(i) a joint venture is not a legal person and therefore the Province
could not and did not contract with a joint venture;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;">(ii) it did not award the contract to EAC and EAC had no contractual
responsibility to the Province for failure to perform the contract;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;">(iii) there was no term of the RFP that restricted the right of
proponents to enter into joint venture agreements with others; this arrangement
merely left Brentwood, the original proponent, in place and allowed it to
enhance its ability to perform the work.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm; ">[15]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
</SPAN>While these were the Province&#146;s main points, its position became
more wide-ranging during oral argument, at times suggesting that it had no
contractual obligation to deal only with eligible bidders.&nbsp; It is therefore
necessary to take a step back and look at that threshold point before turning
to the Province&#146;s more focussed submissions.&nbsp; </P>

</SPAN>The judge found, and it was uncontested at trial, that only the
six original proponents that qualified through the RFEI process were eligible
to submit a response to the RFP.&nbsp; This finding is not challenged on appeal,
although there was a passing suggestion during oral argument that there was no
contractual obligation of this sort at all.&nbsp; The trial judge also held, noting
that this point was uncontested, that a joint venture between Brentwood and EAC
was ineligible to bid.&nbsp; This is also not contested on appeal.&nbsp; These two
findings are critical to the case and provide important background for an issue
that is in dispute, namely whether the Brentwood bid was ineligible.&nbsp; It is,
therefore, worth reviewing the relevant background in detail.&nbsp; I first briefly
set out the legal framework and then turn to the trial judge&#146;s findings.</P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm; ">[18]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
</SPAN>The question of whether Tercon&#146;s submission of a compliant bid
gave rise to contractual relations between it and the Province was contested by
the Province at trial.&nbsp; The trial judge gave extensive reasons for finding
against the Province on this issue. We are told that the Province did not
pursue this point in the Court of Appeal but instead premised its submissions
on the existence of Contract A. The Province took the same approach in its
written submissions in this Court.&nbsp; However, during oral argument, there was
some passing reference in response to questions that there was no Contract A.&nbsp;
In light of the position taken by the Province on its appeal to the Court of
Appeal and in its written submissions in this Court, it is now too late to
revisit whether there were contractual duties between Tercon and the
Province.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if it were open to the Province to make this argument now, I
can see no error in legal principle or any palpable and overriding error of
fact in the trial judge&#146;s careful reasons on this point.&nbsp; </P>

</SPAN>The trial judge did not mechanically impose the Contract A -
Contract B framework, but considered whether Contract A arose in light of her
detailed analysis of the dealings between the parties.&nbsp; That was the right
approach.&nbsp; She reviewed in detail the provisions of the RFP which supported her
conclusion that there was an intent to create contractual relations upon
submission of a compliant bid.&nbsp; She noted, for example, that bids were to be
irrevocable for 60 days and that security of $50,000 had to be paid by all
proponents and was to be increased to $200,000 by the successful proponent.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Any revisions to proposals prior to the closing date had to be in writing,
properly executed and received before the closing time.&nbsp; The RFP also set out
detailed evaluation criteria and specified that they were to be the only criteria
to be used to evaluate proposals. A specific form of alliance&nbsp; agreement was
attached.&nbsp; There were detailed provisions about pricing that were fixed and
non-negotiable.&nbsp; A proponent was required to accept this form of contract
substantially, and security was lost if an agreement was not executed. The
Ministry reserved a right to cancel the RFP under s. 2.9 but in such event was
obliged to reimburse proponents for costs incurred in preparing their bids up
to $15,000 each.&nbsp; Proponents had to submit a signed proposal form, which
established that they offered to execute an agreement substantially in the form
included in the RFP package.&nbsp; Further, they acknowledged that the security
could be forfeited if they were selected as the preferred proponent and failed
to enter into good faith discussions with the Ministry to reach an agreement
and sign the alliance agreement.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm; ">[20]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
</SPAN>&nbsp;In summary, as the trial judge found, the RFP set out a
specifically defined project, invited proposals from a closed and specific list
of eligible proponents, and contemplated that proposals would be evaluated
according to specific criteria.&nbsp; Negotiation of the alliance construction
contract was required, but the negotiation was constrained and did not go to
the fundamental details of either the procurement process or the ultimate
contract.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

</SPAN>There is, therefore, no basis to interfere with the judge&#146;s
finding that there was an intent to create contractual obligations upon
submission of a compliant bid. I add, however, that the tender call in this
case did not give rise to the classic Contract A - Contract B framework in
which the bidder submits an irrevocable bid and undertakes to enter into
contract B on those terms if it is accepted.&nbsp; The alliance model process which
was used&nbsp; here was more complicated than that and involved good faith
negotiations for a contract B in the form set out in the tender documents.&nbsp; But
in my view, this should not distract us from the main question here.&nbsp; We do not
have to spell out all of the terms of Contract A, let alone of Contract B, so
as to define all of the duties and obligations of both the bidders and the
Province.&nbsp; The question here is much narrower: did contractual obligations
arise as a result of Tercon&#146;s compliant bid and, if so, was it a term of that
contract that the Province would only entertain bids from eligible bidders?&nbsp;
The trial judge found offer, acceptance and consideration in the invitation to
tender and Tercon&#146;s bid.&nbsp; There is no basis, in my respectful view, to
challenge that finding even if it were open to the Province to try to do so at
this late stage of the litigation.</P>

</SPAN>It was not contested at trial that only the six original
proponents that qualified through the RFEI process were eligible to bid.&nbsp; This
point is not in issue on appeal; the question is what this eligibility
requirement means.&nbsp; It will be helpful, therefore, to set out the background
about this limited eligibility to bid in this tendering process.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:31.5pt;text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

</SPAN>To begin, it is worth repeating that there is no doubt that the
Province was contractually bound to accept bids only from eligible bidders.&nbsp;
This duty may be implied even absent express stipulation.&nbsp; For example, in <I>M.J.B</I>.,
the Court found that an implied obligation to accept only compliant bids was
necessary to give business efficacy to the tendering process, noting, at para.
41, that a bidder must expend effort and incur expense in preparing its bid and
must submit bid security and that it is &#147;obvious&#148; that it makes &#147;little sense&#148;
for the bidder to comply with these requirements if the owner &#147;is allowed, in
effect, to circumscribe this process and accept a non-compliant bid&#148;.&nbsp; But
again, whether such a duty should be implied in any given case will depend on
the dealings between the parties.&nbsp; Here, however, there is no need to rely on
implied terms.&nbsp; The obligation to consider only bids from eligible bidders was
stated expressly in the tender documents and in the required ministerial
approval of the process which they described.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm; ">[24]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
</SPAN>As noted, in early 2000, the Province issued a RFEI based on a
design-build model; the contractor would both design and build the highway.&nbsp;
The RFEI contemplated that a short list of three qualified contractors, or teams
composed of contractors and consultants, would be nominated as proponents.&nbsp;
Each was to provide a description of the legal structure of the team and to
describe the role of each team member along with the extent of involvement of
each team member as a percentage of the total scope of the project and an
organization chart showing each team member&#146;s role.&nbsp; Any change in team
management or key positions required notice in writing to the Province which
reserved the right to disqualify the proponent if the change materially and
negatively affected the ability of the team to carry out the project.&nbsp; </P>

</SPAN>Expressions of interest (&#147;EOI&#148;) were received from six teams
including Tercon and Brentwood.&nbsp; The evaluation panel and independent review
panel recommended a short list of three proponents with Tercon topping the
evaluation.&nbsp; Brentwood was evaluated fifth and was not on the short list.
Brentwood was known to lack expertise in drilling and blasting and so its EOI
had included an outline of the key team members with that experience.&nbsp; EAC did
not participate and had no role in the Brentwood submission.&nbsp; The results of
this evaluation were not communicated and the process did not proceed because
the Province decided to design the project itself and issue an RFP for an
alliance model contract to construct the highway.</P>

</SPAN>It was clear from the outset that only those who had submitted
proposals during the RFEI process would be eligible to submit proposals under
the RFP.&nbsp; This was specified in the approval of the process by the Minister of
Transportation and Highways (&#147;Minister&#148;) before the RFP was issued.&nbsp; It is
worth pausing here to briefly look at the Minister&#146;s role.</P>

</SPAN>Pursuant to s. 23 of the<I> Ministry of Transportation and
Highways Act</I>, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 311, the legislation in force at the

construction unless he or she determined that another process would result in
competitively established costs for the work.&nbsp; The section provided:</P>

</SPAN>These provisions make clear that the work in this case had to be
awarded by public tender, absent the Minister&#146;s approval of an alternative
process, and had to be awarded to the lowest bidder, absent approval of the
Lieutenant Governor in Council.&nbsp; As noted, ministerial approval was given for
an alternative process under s. 23(1)(c).&nbsp; The Minister issued a notice that,
pursuant to that section, he approved the process set out in an attached
document and had determined it to be an alternative contracting process that
would result in competitively established costs for the performance of the
work.&nbsp; The attached document outlined in seven numbered paragraphs the process
that had been approved.&nbsp; </P>

</SPAN>The document described the background of the public RFEI (which I
have set out earlier), noting that <I>only those firms identified through the
EOI process would be eligible to submit proposals for the work </I>and that
they would receive invitations to do so.&nbsp; The Minister&#146;s approval in fact
referred to the firms who had been short-listed from the RFEI process as being
eligible.&nbsp; If this were taken to refer only to the three proponents identified
by the evaluation process of the RFEI, Tercon would be included but Brentwood
would not.&nbsp; However, no one has suggested that anything turns on this and it
seems clear that ultimately all six of the RFEI proponents &#151; including both
Tercon and Brentwood &#151;&nbsp; were intended to be eligible. The ministerial approval
then briefly set out the process. Proposals &#147;by short listed firms&#148; were to be
evaluated &#147;using the considerations set out in the RFP&#148;.&nbsp; </P>

</SPAN>The Province&#146;s factum implies that the Minister approved
inclusion of the exclusion clause in the RFP.&nbsp; However, there is no evidence of
this in the record before the Court.&nbsp; The Minister&#146;s approval is before us.&nbsp; It
is dated as having been prepared on August 23, 2000 and signed on October 19,
2000, and approves a process outlined in a two-page document attached to it.&nbsp;
It says nothing about &nbsp;exclusion of the Province&#146;s liability.&nbsp; The RFP,
containing the exclusion clause in issue here, is dated January 15, 2001 and
was sent out to eligible bidders under cover of a letter of the same date, some
three months after the Minister&#146;s approval.</P>

</SPAN>The RFP is a lengthy document, containing detailed instructions
to proponents, required forms, a time schedule of the work, detailed provisions

many other things.&nbsp; Most relevant for our purposes are the terms of the
instructions to proponents and in particular the eligibility requirements for

</SPAN>The RFP reiterates in unequivocal terms that eligibility to bid
was restricted as set out in the ministerial approval.&nbsp; It also underlines the
significance of the identity of the proponent.&nbsp;&nbsp; In s. 1.1, the RFP specifies
that only the six teams involved in the RFEI would be eligible.&nbsp; The term
&#147;proponent&#148;, which refers to a bidder,&nbsp; is defined in s. 8 as &#147;a team that has become
eligible to respond to the RFP as described in Section 1.1 of the Instructions
to Proponents&#148;.&nbsp; Section 2.8(a) of the RFP stipulates
that <I>only</I> the six proponents qualified through the RFEI process were
eligible and that<I> proposals received from any other party would not be
considered</I>. In short, there were potentially only six participants and
&#147;Contract A&#148; could not arise by the submission of a bid from any other party.</P>

</SPAN>The RFP also addressed material changes to the proponent,
including changes in the proponent&#146;s team members and its financial ability to
undertake and complete the work.&nbsp; Section 2.8(b) of the RFP provided in part as
follows:</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify">If in the
opinion of the Ministry a material change has occurred to the Proponent since
its qualification under the RFEI, including if the composition of the
Proponent&#146;s team members has changed ... or if, for financial or other reasons,
the Proponent&#146;s ability to undertake and complete the Work has changed, then
the Ministry may request the Proponent to submit further supporting information
as the Ministry may request in support of the Proponent&#146;s qualification to
perform the Work.&nbsp; If in the sole discretion of the Ministry as a result of the
changes the Proponent is not sufficiently qualified to perform the Work then
the Ministry reserves the right to disqualify that Proponent and reject its

</SPAN>The RFP provided proponents with a mechanism to determine whether
they remained qualified to submit a proposal.&nbsp; If a proponent was concerned
about its eligibility as a result of a material change, it could make a
preliminary submission to the Ministry describing the nature of the changes and
the Ministry would give a written decision as to whether the proponent was
still qualified: s. 2.8(b).&nbsp; </P>

</SPAN>Brentwood tried to take advantage of this process. The trial
judge thoroughly outlined this, at paras. 17-23 of her reasons. In brief,
Brentwood lacked expertise in drilling and blasting and by the time the RFP was
issued, it faced limited local bonding capacity due to commitments to other
projects, a shorter construction period, the potential unavailability of
subcontractors and limited equipment to perform the work.&nbsp; It in fact
considered not bidding at all.&nbsp; Instead, however, it entered into a pre-bidding
agreement with EAC that the work would be undertaken by a joint venture of
Brentwood and EAC and that upon being awarded the work, they would enter into a
joint venture agreement and would share 50-50 the costs, expenses, losses and
gains. The trial judge noted that it was common in the industry for contractors
to agree to a joint venture on the basis of a pre-bid agreement with the
specifics of the joint venture to be worked out once the contract was awarded
and that Brentwood and EAC acted consistently throughout in accordance with
this industry standard.</P>

</SPAN>Brentwood sent the Province&#146;s project manager, Mr. Tasaka, a
preliminary submission as provided for in s. 2.8(b) of the RFP, advising of a
material change in its team&#146;s structure in that it wished to form a joint
venture with EAC. This was done, the trial judge found, because Brentwood
thought it would be disqualified if it submitted a proposal as a joint venture
without the Ministry&#146;s prior approval under this section of the RFP.&nbsp; The
Province never responded in writing as it ought to have according to s.
2.8(b).&nbsp; </P>

</SPAN>It seems to have been assumed by everyone that a joint venture of
Brentwood and EAC was not eligible because this change would not simply be a
change in the composition of the bidder&#146;s team, but in effect a new bidder.
Without reviewing in detail&nbsp; all of the evidence referred to by the trial
judge, it is fair to say that although Brentwood ultimately submitted a
proposal in its own name, the proposal in substance was from the Brentwood-EAC
joint venture and was evaluated as such.&nbsp; As the trial judge concluded:</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:78.45pt;text-align:justify">The substance
of the proposal was as a joint venture and this must have been apparent to
all.&nbsp; The [project evaluation panel] approved Brentwood/EAC as joint venturers
as the preferred proponent.&nbsp; The [panel] was satisfied that Tercon had the

</SPAN>There was some suggestion by the Province during oral argument
that the trial judge had wrongly imposed on it a duty to investigate
Brentwood&#146;s bid, a duty rejected by the majority of the Court in <I>Double N
Earthmovers Ltd. v. Edmonton (City)</I>, 2007 SCC 3, [2007] 1 S.C.R. 116.&nbsp; In
my view, the trial judge did no such thing.&nbsp; As her detailed findings make
clear, the Province: (1) fully understood that the Brentwood bid was in fact on
behalf of a joint venture of Brentwood and EAC; (2) thought that a bid from
that joint venture was not eligible; and (3) took active steps to obscure the
reality of the situation. No investigation was required for the Province to
know these things and the judge imposed no duty to engage in one.</P>

</SPAN>I cannot accept these submissions.&nbsp; The issue is not, as these
arguments assume, whether the Province contracted with a joint venture or
whether EAC had contractual obligations to the Province.&nbsp; The issue is whether
the Province considered an&nbsp; ineligible bid; the point of substance is whether
the bid was from an eligible bidder. </P>

</SPAN>At trial there was no contest that a bid from a joint venture
involving an ineligible bidder would be ineligible.&nbsp; The Province&#146;s position
was that there was no need to look beyond the face of the bid to determine who
was bidding: the proposal was in the name of Brentwood and therefore the bid
was from a compliant bidder.&nbsp; Respectfully, I see no error in the trial judge&#146;s
rejection of this position. There was a mountain of evidence to support the
judge&#146;s conclusions that first,&nbsp; Brentwood&#146;s bid, in fact if not in form, was
on behalf of a joint venture between itself and EAC; second, the Province knew
this and took the position that it could not consider a bid from or award the
work to that joint venture; third,&nbsp; the existence of the joint venture was a
material consideration in favour of the Brentwood bid during the evaluation
process; and finally, that steps were taken by revising and drafting
documentation to obfuscate the reality of the situation.</P>

</SPAN>Brentwood was one of the original RFEI proponents and was of
course eligible to bid, subject to material changes in the composition of its
team.&nbsp; EAC had not submitted a proposal during the RFEI process.&nbsp; It had been
involved in advising the Ministry in relation to the project in 1998 and, in
the fall of 2000, the Ministry had asked EAC to prepare an internal bid for
comparison purposes (although EAC did not do so) as EAC was not entitled to bid
on the Project.</P>

</SPAN>As noted earlier, after the RFP was issued, Brentwood and EAC
entered into a pre-bidding agreement that provided that the work would be
undertaken in the name of Brentwood-Anderson, a joint venture, that the work
would be sponsored and managed by the joint venture and that upon being awarded
the contract, the parties would enter into a joint venture agreement.&nbsp;
Brentwood advised the Ministry in writing that it was forming a joint venture
with EAC &#147;to submit a more competitive price&#148;; this fax was in effect a
preliminary submission contemplated by s. 2.8(b) of the RFP and was written, as
the trial judge found, because Brentwood assumed that it could be disqualified
if it submitted a proposal as a joint venture unless prior arrangements had been
made . The Province never responded in writing to this preliminary submission,
as required by s. 2.8(b).&nbsp; There were, however, discussions with the Province&#146;s
project manager, Mr. Tasaka who, the trial judge found, understood that a joint
venture from Brentwood and EAC would not be eligible.&nbsp;&nbsp; As the judge put it,
the Province&#146;s position appears to have been that the Brentwood/EAC proposal
could proceed as long as the submission was in the name of Brentwood.&nbsp; </P>

</SPAN>In the result, EAC was listed in the ultimate submission as a
&#147;major member&#148; of the team.&nbsp; The legal relationship with EAC was not specified
and EAC was listed as a subcontractor even though, as the trial judge found,
their relationship bore no resemblance to a standard subcontractor agreement.
The trial judge found as&nbsp; facts &#151; and these findings are not challenged &#151;&nbsp; that
Brentwood and EAC always intended between themselves to form a joint venture
and to formalize that arrangement once the contract was secured, and further,
that the role of EAC was purposefully obfuscated in the bid to avoid an
apparent conflict with s. 2.8(a) of the RFP.</P>

</SPAN>During the selection process, it became clear that the bid was in
reality on behalf of a joint venture.&nbsp; The project evaluation panel (&#147;PEP&#148;)
requested better information than provided in the bid about the structure of
the business arrangements between Brentwood and EAC.&nbsp; Brentwood responded by
disclosing the pre-bid agreement between them to form a 50/50 joint venture if
successful.&nbsp; The PEP understood from this that Brentwood and EAC had a similar
interest in the risk and reward under the contract and that this helped satisfy
them that the &#147;risk/reward&#148; aspect of the alliance contract could be negotiated
with them flexibly. The PEP clearly did not consider EAC to be a subcontractor
although shown as such in the bid.&nbsp; In its step 6 report, the PEP consistently
referred to the proponent as being a joint venture of Brentwood and EAC or as
&#147;Brentwood/EAC&#148; and the trial judge found that it was on the basis that they
were indeed a joint venture that PEP approved Brentwood/EAC as the preferred
proponent.&nbsp; This step 6 report was ultimately revised to refer only to the
Brentwood team as the official proponent.&nbsp; The trial judge found as a fact that
this revision was made because &#147;it was apparent that a joint venture was not
eligible to submit a proposal&#148;(para. 56).</P>

</SPAN>The findings of the trial judge and the record make it clear that
it was no mere question of form rather than a matter of substance whether the
bidder was Brentwood with other team members or, as it in fact was, the
Brentwood/EAC joint venture.&nbsp; As she noted, at para. 121 of her reasons, the
whole purpose of the joint venture was to allow submission of a more
competitive price than it would have been able to do as a proponent with a team
as allowed under s. 2.8(b) of the RFP.&nbsp; The joint venture permitted a 50/50
sharing of risk and reward and co-management of the project while at the same
time avoiding the restrictions on subcontracting in the tendering documents.&nbsp;
As the judge put it, the bid by the joint venture constituted &#147;material
non-compliance&#148; with the tendering contract: &#147;[t]he joint venture with EAC
allowed Brentwood to put forward a more competitive price than contemplated
under the RFEI proposal.&nbsp; This went to the essence of the tendering process&#148;
(para 126).</P>

</SPAN>The Province suggests that the trial judge&#146;s reasons allow form
to triumph over substance.&nbsp; In my view, it is the Province&#146;s position that
better deserves that description.&nbsp; It had a bid which it knew to be on behalf
of a joint venture, encouraged the bid to proceed and took steps to obfuscate
the reality that it was on behalf of a joint venture.&nbsp; Permitting the bid to
proceed in this way gave the joint venture a competitive advantage in the
bidding process, and the record could not be clearer that the joint venture
nature of the bid was one of its attractions during the selection process. The
Province nonetheless submits that so long as only the name of Brentwood appears
on the bid and ultimate contract B, all is well.&nbsp; If ever a submission
advocated placing form above substance, this is it.</P>

</SPAN>It is true that the Province had legal advice and did not proceed
in defiance of it.&nbsp; However, the facts as found by the trial judge about this
legal advice hardly advance the Province&#146;s position.&nbsp; The judge found that the
Province&#146;s lawyer was not aware of the background relevant to the question of
whether the Brentwood bid was eligible, never reviewed the proponent eligibility
requirements in the RFP and was not asked to and did not direct his mind to the
question of eligibility.&nbsp; As the trial judge put it, the lawyer &#147;appears to
have operated on the assumption that Brentwood had been irreversibly selected&#148;
(para. 70). </P>

</SPAN>The Brentwood/EAC joint venture having been selected as the
preferred proponent, negotiations for the alliance contract ensued.&nbsp; The trial
judge found that by this time, all agreed that a joint venture was not an
eligible proponent and the Ministry was taking the position that the contract
could not be in the name of the joint venture.&nbsp; Brentwood and EAC executed a
revised pre-contract agreement that provided, notwithstanding the letter of
intent from the Ministry addressed to Brentwood indicating that the legal
relationship between them would be contractor/subcontractor, the contract would
be performed and the profits shared equally between them.&nbsp; The work was to be
managed by a committee with equal representation, the bond required by the owner
was to be provided by both parties and EAC indemnified Brentwood against half
of any loss or cost incurred as a result of performance of the work.&nbsp; According
to schedule B4 of the RFP, all subcontracts were to be attached to the RFP but
no contract between Brentwood and EAC was ever provided or attached to the
proposal.&nbsp; </P>

</SPAN>The Province has identified no palpable and overriding error in
these many findings of fact by the trial judge.&nbsp; I conclude, therefore, that we
must approach the case on the basis of the judge&#146;s finding that the bid was in
fact, if not in form, submitted by a joint venture of Brentwood and EAC, that
the Ministry was well aware of this, that the existence of the joint venture
was a material consideration in favour of the bid during the evaluation process
and that by bidding as a joint venture, Brentwood was given a competitive
advantage in the bidding process. </P>

</SPAN>I reject the Ministry&#146;s submissions that all that matters is the

</SPAN>I turn to the Province&#146;s third point:</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;">(iii) there was no term of the RFP that restricted the right of
proponents to enter into joint venture agreements with others; this arrangement
merely left Brentwood, the original proponent in place and allowed it to
enhance its ability to perform the work.</P>

</SPAN>This submission addresses the question of whether the joint
venture was an eligible bidder.&nbsp; The Province submits that it is, arguing that
s. 2.8(b) of the RFP shows that the RFP contemplated that each proponent would
be supported by a team, that the composition of the team might change and that
the Province under that section retained the right to approve or reject changes
in the team of any proponent.&nbsp; I cannot accept these submissions.</P>

</SPAN>Section 2.8 must be read as a whole and in light of the
ministerial approval which I have described earlier.&nbsp; Section 2.8(a),
consistent with that approval, stipulates that only the six proponents
qualified through the RFEI process were eligible to submit responses and that
proposals from any other party &#147;shall not be considered&#148;.&nbsp; The word &#147;proponent&#148;
is defined in s. 8 as a team that has become eligible to respond to the RFP.&nbsp;
The material change provisions in s. 2.8(b) should not be read as negating the
express provisions of the RFP and the ministerial approval of the process. When
read as a whole, the provisions about material change do not permit the
addition of a new entity as occurred here.&nbsp; The process actually followed was
not the one specified in the bidding contract and was not authorized by the
statute because it was not the one approved by the Minister.</P>

</SPAN>&nbsp;Moreover, even if one were to conclude (and I would not) that
this change from the Brentwood team that participated in the RFEI to the
Brentwood/EAC joint venture by whom the bid was submitted could fall within the
material change provisions of s. 2.8(b), the Province never gave a written
decision to permit this change as required by that provision.&nbsp; As the trial
judge noted, in fact the Province&#146;s position was that such a bid would not be
eligible and its agents took steps to obfuscate the true proponent in the
relevant documentation.</P>

failing to treat all bidders equally by changing the terms of eligibility to
Brentwood&#146;s competitive advantage.&nbsp; This conclusion strongly reinforces the
trial judge&#146;s decision about eligibility.&nbsp; Rather than repeating her detailed
findings, I will simply quote her summary at para. 138: </P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent: 20.85pt">The whole of [the Province&#146;s] conduct leaves me with no doubt that the
[Province] breached the duty of fairness to [Tercon] by changing the terms of
eligibility to Brentwood&#146;s competitive advantage.&nbsp; At best, [the Province]
ignored significant information to its [i.e. Tercon&#146;s] detriment. At worst, the
[Province] covered up its knowledge that the successful proponent was an
ineligible joint venture.&nbsp; In the circumstances here, it is not open to the&nbsp;
[Province] to say that a joint venture was only proposed.&nbsp; Nor can the
[Province] say that it was unaware of the joint venture when it acted
deliberately to structure contract B to include EAC as fully responsible within
a separate contract with Brentwood, so minimizing the [Province&#146;s] risk that
the contract would be unenforceable against EAC if arrangements did not work
out. .... The [Province] was ... prepared to take the risk that&nbsp; unsuccessful
bidders would sue: this risk did materialize. </P>

</SPAN>To conclude on this point, I find no fault with the trial judge&#146;s
conclusion that the bid was in fact submitted on behalf of a joint venture of
Brentwood and EAC which was an ineligible bidder under the terms of the RFP.
This breached not only the express eligibility provisions of the tender
documents, but also the implied duty to act fairly towards all bidders.</P>

the analytical approach that should be followed when tackling an issue relating
to the applicability of an exclusion clause set out by my colleague Binnie J.&nbsp;
However, I respectfully do not agree with him on the question of the proper
interpretation of the clause in issue here.&nbsp; In my view, the clause does not
exclude Tercon&#146;s claim for damages, and even if I am wrong about that, the
clause is at best ambiguous and should be construed <I>contra proferentem</I>
as the trial judge held.&nbsp; As a result of my conclusion on the interpretation

</SPAN>&nbsp;In my view, the exclusion clause does not cover the Province&#146;s
breaches in this case.&nbsp; The RFP process put in place by the Province&nbsp; was
premised on a closed list of bidders; a contest with an ineligible bidder was
not part of the RFP process and was in fact expressly precluded by its terms.&nbsp;
A &#147;Contract A&#148; could not arise as a result of submission of a bid from any
other party.&nbsp; However, as a result of how the Province proceeded, the very
premise of its own RFP process was missing, and the work was awarded to a party
who could not be a participant in the RFP process.&nbsp; That is what Tercon is
complaining about.&nbsp; Tercon&#146;s claim is not barred by the exclusion clause
because the clause only applies to claims arising &#147;as a result of participating
in [the] RFP&#148;, not to claims resulting from the participation of other, ineligible
parties.&nbsp; Moreover, the words of this exclusion clause, in my view, are not
effective to limit liability for breach of the Province&#146;s implied duty of
fairness to bidders. I will explain my conclusion by turning first to a brief
account of the key legal principles and then to the facts of the case.</P>

</SPAN>The key principle of contractual interpretation here is that the
words of one provision must not be read in isolation but should be considered
in harmony with the rest of the contract and in light of its purposes and
commercial context.&nbsp; The approach adopted by the Court in <I>M.J.B</I>. is
instructive. The Court had to interpret a privilege clause, which is somewhat
analogous to the exclusion clause in issue here.&nbsp; The privilege clause provided
that the lowest or any tender would not necessarily be accepted, and the issue
was whether this barred a claim based on breach of an implied term that the
owner would accept only compliant bids. In interpreting the privilege clause,
the Court looked at its text in light of the contract as a whole, its purposes
and commercial context.&nbsp; As Iacobucci J. said, at para. 44, &#147;the privilege
clause is only one term of Contract A and must be read in harmony with the rest
of the tender documents.&nbsp; To do otherwise would undermine the rest of the
agreement between the parties.&#148;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>

</SPAN>In a similar way, it is necessary in the present case to consider
the exclusion clause in the RFP in light of its purposes and commercial context
as well as of its overall terms.&nbsp; The question is whether the exclusion of
compensation for claims resulting from &#147;participating in this RFP&#148;, properly
interpreted, excludes liability for the Province having unfairly considered a
bid from a bidder&nbsp; who was not supposed to have been participating in the RFP
process at all.</P>

</SPAN>To begin, it is helpful to recall that in interpreting tendering
contracts, the Court has been careful to consider the special commercial
context of&nbsp; tendering.&nbsp; Effective tendering ultimately depends on the integrity
and business efficacy of the tendering process: see, e. g., <I>Martel</I>, at
para. 88; <I>M.J.B</I>., at para. 41; <I>Double N Earthmovers Ltd.</I>, at
para. 106.&nbsp;&nbsp; As Iacobucci and Major JJ. put it in <I>Martel</I>, at para.
116,&#147;it is imperative that all bidders be treated on an equal footing ...&nbsp;
Parties should at the very least be confident that their initial bids will not
be skewed by some underlying advantage in the drafting of the call for tenders
conferred upon only one potential bidder&#148;.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm; ">[68]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
</SPAN>This factor is particularly weighty in the context of public
procurement.&nbsp; In that context, in addition to the interests of the parties,
there is the need for transparency for the public at large.&nbsp; This consideration
is underlined by the statutory provisions which governed the tendering process
in this case.&nbsp; Their purpose was to assure transparency and fairness in public
tenders.&nbsp; As was said by Orsborn J. (as he then was) in<I> Cahill (G. J.)&amp;
Co. (1979) Ltd. v. Newfoundland and Labrador (Minister of Municipal and
Provincial Affairs)</I>, 2005 NLTD 129, 250 Nfld. &amp; P.E.I.R. 145, at para.

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:78.45pt;text-align:justify;text-indent: 13.7pt">The owner &#151;&nbsp; in this case the government &#151;&nbsp; is in control of the
tendering process and may define the parameters for a compliant bid and a
compliant bidder. The corollary to this, of course, is that once the owner &#151;&nbsp;
here the government &#151; sets the rules, it must itself play by those rules in
assessing the bids and awarding the main contract.</P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt; ">[69]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">
</SPAN>One aspect that is generally seen as contributing to the
integrity and business efficacy of the tendering process is the&nbsp; requirement
that only compliant bids be&nbsp; considered.&nbsp; As noted earlier, such a requirement
has often been implied because, as the Court said in <I>M.J.B</I>.,&nbsp; it makes
little sense to think that a bidder would comply with the bidding process if
the owner could circumscribe it by accepting a non-compliant bid.&nbsp;
Respectfully, it seems to me to make even less sense to think that eligible
bidders would participate in the RFP if the Province could avoid liability for
ignoring an express term concerning eligibility to bid on which the entire RFP
was premised and which was mandated by the statutorily approved process.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

</SPAN>&nbsp;The closed list&nbsp; of bidders was&nbsp; the foundation of this RFP and
there were important competitive advantages to a bidder who could side-step
that limitation. Thus, it seems to me that both the integrity and the business
efficacy of the tendering process support an interpretation that would allow
the exclusion clause to operate compatibly with the eligibility limitations
that were at the very root of the RFP.</P>

</SPAN>The same may be said with respect to the implied duty of
fairness.&nbsp; As Iacobucci and Major JJ. wrote for the Court in <I>Martel</I>,<I> </I>at
para. 88, &#147;[i]mplying an obligation to treat all bidders fairly and equally is
consistent with the goal of protecting and promoting the integrity of the
bidding process.&#148;&nbsp; It seems to me that clear language is necessary to exclude
liability for breach of such a basic requirement of the tendering process,
particularly in the case of public procurement.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>

</SPAN>The proper interpretation of the exclusion clause should also
take account of the statutory context which I have reviewed earlier.&nbsp; The restriction
on eligibility of bidders was a key element of the alternative process approved
by the Minister.&nbsp; It seems unlikely, therefore, that the parties intended
through this exclusion clause to effectively gut a key aspect of the approved
process.&nbsp; Of course, it is true that&nbsp; the exclusion clause does not bar all
remedies, but only claims for compensation.&nbsp; However, the fact remains that as
a practical matter, there are unlikely to be other, effective remedies for
considering and accepting an ineligible bid and that barring compensation for a
breach of that nature in practical terms renders the ministerial approval
process virtually meaningless.&nbsp; Whatever administrative law remedies may be
available,&nbsp; they are not likely to be effective remedies for awarding a
contract to an ineligible bidder. The Province did not submit that injunctive
relief would have been an option, and I can, in any event, foresee many
practical problems that need not detain us here in seeking such relief in these
circumstances.</P>

</SPAN>The Province stresses Tercon&#146;s commercial sophistication, in
effect arguing that it agreed to the exclusion clause and must accept the
consequences.&nbsp; This line of argument, however, has two weaknesses.&nbsp; It assumes
the answer to the real question before us which is: what does the exclusion
clause mean?&nbsp; The consequences of agreeing to the exclusion clause depend on
its construction. In addition, the Province&#146;s submission overlooks its own
commercial sophistication and the fact that sophisticated parties can draft
very clear exclusion and limitation clauses when they are minded to do so.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Such clauses contrast starkly with the curious clause which the Province
inserted into this RFP.&nbsp; The limitation of liability clause in <I>Hunter
Engineering</I>, for example, provided that &#147;[n]otwithstanding any other
provision in this contract or any applicable statutory provisions neither the
Seller nor the Buyer shall be liable to the other for special or consequential
damages or damages for loss of use arising directly or indirectly from any
breach of this contract, fundamental or otherwise ...&#148; (p. 450).&nbsp;&nbsp; The Court
found this to be clear and unambiguous. The limitation clause in issue in <I>Guarantee
Co. of North America v. Gordon Capital Corp.</I> [1999] 3 S.C.R. 423, provided
that legal proceedings for the recovery of &#147;any loss hereunder shall not be
brought ... after the expiration of 24 months from the discovery of such loss&#148;
(para. 5). Once again, the Court found this language clear.&nbsp; The Ontario Court
of Appeal similarly found the language of a limitation of liability clause to
be clear in <I>Fraser Jewellers (1982) Ltd. v. Dominion Electric Protection Co.
</I>(1997), 34 O.R. (3d) 1.&nbsp; The clause provided in part that if the defendant
&#147;should be found liable for loss, damage or injury due to a failure of service
or equipment in any respect, its liability shall be limited to a sum equal to
100% or the annual service charge or $10,000, whichever is less, as the agreed
upon damages and not as a penalty, as the exclusive remedy ...&#148; (p. 4). These,
and many other cases which might be referred to, demonstrate that sophisticated
parties are capable of drafting clear and comprehensive limitation and
exclusion provisions.&nbsp; </P>

</SPAN>I turn to the text of the clause which the Province inserted in
its RFP.&nbsp; It addresses claims that result from &#147;participating in this RFP&#148;.&nbsp;&nbsp;
As noted, the limitation on who could participate in this RFP was one of its
premises. These words must, therefore, be read in light of the limit on who was
eligible to participate in this RFP.&nbsp; As noted earlier, both the ministerial
approval and the&nbsp; text of the RFP itself were unequivocal: only the six
proponents qualified through the earlier RFEI process were eligible and <I>proposals
received from any other party would not be considered</I>.&nbsp; Thus, central to
&#147;participating in this RFP&#148; was participating in a contest among those eligible
to participate.&nbsp; A process involving other bidders, as the trial judge found
the process followed by the Province to be, is not the process called for by
&#147;this RFP&#148; and being part of that other process is not in any meaningful sense
&#147;participating in this RFP&#148;.&nbsp; </P>

</SPAN>&nbsp;The Province would have us interpret the phrase excluding
compensation &#147;as a result of participating in this RFP&#148; to mean that
compensation is excluded that results from &#147;submitting a Proposal&#148;.&nbsp; However,
that interpretation is not consistent with the wording of the clause as a
whole.&nbsp; The clause concludes with the phrase that &#147;by submitting a Proposal
each Proponent shall be deemed to have agreed that it has no claim&#148;.&nbsp; If the
phrases &#147;participating in this RFP&#148; and &#147;submitting a Proposal&#148; were intended
to mean the same thing, it is hard to understand why different words were used
in the same short clause to express the same idea.&nbsp; The fact that the Minister
had approved a closed list of participants strengthens the usual inference that
the use of different words was deliberate so as not to exclude compensation for
a departure from that basic eligibility requirement.</P>

</SPAN>This interpretation of the exclusion clause does not rob it of
meaning, but makes it compatible with other provisions of the RFP.&nbsp; There is a
parallel between this case and the Court&#146;s decision in <I>M.J.B.</I>&nbsp; There,
the Court found that there was compatibility between the privilege clause and
the implied term to accept only compliant bids.&nbsp; Similarly, in this case, there
is compatibility between the eligibility requirements of the RFP and the
exclusion clause.&nbsp; Not any and every claim based on any and every deviation
from the RFP provisions would escape the preclusive effect of the exclusion
clause. It is only when the defect in the Province&#146;s adherence to the RFP
process is such that it is completely outside that process that the exclusion
clause&nbsp; cannot have been intended to operate.&nbsp; What is important here, in my
view, is that the RFP in its conception, in its express provisions and in the
statutorily required approval it was given, was premised on limiting
eligibility to the six proponents in the RFEI process.&nbsp; Competition among
others was not at all contemplated and was not part of the RFP process; in
fact, the RFP expressly excluded that possibility.&nbsp; In short,&nbsp;&nbsp; limiting&nbsp;
eligibility of bidders to those who had responded to the RFEI was the foundation
of the whole RFP.&nbsp; As the judge found, acceptance of a bid from an ineligible
bidder &#147; attacks the underlying premise of the process&#148; established by the RFP:
para. 146.&nbsp; Liability for such an attack is not excluded by a clause limiting
compensation resulting from participation in this RFP.</P>

</SPAN>This interpretation is also supported by another provision of the
RFP.&nbsp; Under s. 2.9, as mentioned earlier, the Province reserved to itself the
right to unilaterally cancel the RFP and the right to propose a new RFP
allowing additional bidders.&nbsp; If the exclusion clause were broad enough to
exclude compensation for allowing ineligible bidders to participate, there
seems to be little purpose in this reservation of the ability to&nbsp; cancel the
RFP and issue a new one to a wider circle of bidders.&nbsp; It is also significant
that the Province did not reserve to itself the right to accept a bid from an
ineligible bidder&nbsp; or to unilaterally change the rules of eligibility.&nbsp; The RFP
expressly did exactly the opposite.&nbsp; None of this, in my opinion, supports the
view that the exclusion clause should be read as applying to the Province&#146;s
conduct in this case.</P>

</SPAN>To hold otherwise seems to me to be inconsistent with the text of
the clause read in the context of the RFP as a whole and in light of its
purposes and commercial context. In short, I cannot accept the contention that,
by agreeing to exclude compensation for participating in this RFP process, the
parties could have intended to exclude a damages claim resulting from the
Province unfairly permitting a bidder to participate who was not eligible to do
so.&nbsp; I cannot conclude that the provision was intended to gut the RFP&#146;s
eligibility requirements as to who may participate in it, or to render
meaningless the Minister&#146;s statutorily required approval of the alternative
process where this was a key element.&nbsp; The provision, as well, was not intended
to allow the Province to escape a damages claim for applying different
eligibility criteria, to the competitive disadvantage of other bidders and for
taking steps designed to disguise the true state of affairs.&nbsp; I cannot conclude
that the parties, through the words found in this exclusion clause, intended to
waive compensation for conduct like that of the Province in this case that
strikes at the heart of the integrity and business efficacy of the tendering
process which it undertook.</P>

</SPAN>If I am wrong about my interpretation of the clause, I would
hold, as did the trial judge, that its language is at least ambiguous.&nbsp; If, as
the Province contends, the phrase &#147;participating in this RFP&#148; could reasonably
mean &#147;submitting a Proposal&#148;, that phrase could also reasonably mean &#147;competing
against the other eligible participants&#148;.&nbsp; Any ambiguity in the context of this
contract requires that the clause be interpreted against the Province and in
favour of Tercon under the principle <I>contra proferentem</I>: see, e.g. <I>Hillis
Oil and Sales Ltd. v. Wynn&#146;s Canada, Ltd.</I>, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 57, at pp.
68-69. Following this approach, the clause would not apply to bar Tercon&#146;s

involved consideration of what is known as the doctrine of fundamental breach,
a doctrine which Dickson C.J. in <I>Hunter Engineering Co. v. Syncrude Canada

</SPAN>On this occasion we should again attempt to shut the coffin on
the jargon associated with &#147;fundamental breach&#148;.&nbsp; Categorizing a contract
breach as &#147;fundamental&#148; or &#147;immense&#148; or &#147;colossal&#148; is not particularly
helpful.&nbsp; Rather, the principle is that a court has no discretion to refuse to
enforce a valid and applicable contractual exclusion clause unless the
plaintiff (here the appellant Tercon) can point to some paramount consideration
of public policy sufficient to override the public interest in freedom of contact
and defeat what would otherwise be the contractual rights of the parties.&nbsp;
Tercon points to the public interest in the transparency and integrity of the
government tendering process (in this case, for a highway construction
contract) but in my view such a concern, while important, did not render
unenforceable the terms of the contract Tercon agreed to.&nbsp; There is nothing
inherently unreasonable about exclusion clauses.&nbsp; Tercon is a large and
sophisticated corporation.&nbsp; Unlike my colleague Justice Cromwell, I would hold
that the respondent Ministry&#146;s conduct, while in breach of its contractual
obligations, fell within the terms of the exclusion clause.&nbsp; In turn, there is
no reason why the clause should not be enforced.&nbsp; I would dismiss the appeal.</P>

</SPAN>This appeal concerns a contract to build a $35 million road in
the remote Nass Valley of British Columbia (the &#147;Kincolith project&#148;).&nbsp; The
respondent Ministry accepted a bid from Brentwood Enterprises Ltd. that did not
comply with the terms of tender.&nbsp; Tercon, as the disappointed finalist in the
bidding battle, seeks compensation equivalent to the profit it expected to earn
had it been awarded the contract. </P>

</SPAN>Tercon alleged, and the trial judge found, that although the
winning bid was submitted in the name of Brentwood (an eligible bidder)
Brentwood in fact intended, with the Ministry&#146;s knowledge and encouragement, to
do the work in a co-venture with an ineligible bidder, Emil Anderson
Construction Co. (&#147;EAC&#148;).&nbsp; The respondent Ministry raised a number of defences
including the fact that the formal contract was signed in the name of Brentwood
alone.&nbsp; This defence was rejected in the courts below.&nbsp; The Ministry&#146;s
substantial defence in this Court is that even if it failed to abide by the
bidding rules, it is nonetheless protected by an exclusion of compensation
clause set out clearly in the request for proposals (&#147;RFP&#148;).&nbsp; The clause
provided that &#147;no Proponent shall have any claim for compensation of any kind
whatsoever, as a result of participating in this RFP&#148; and that &#147;by submitting a
Proposal each Proponent shall be deemed to have agreed that it has no claim&#148;
(s. 2.10 of the RFP).&nbsp; </P>

</SPAN>The appeal thus brings into conflict the public policy that
favours a fair, open and transparent bid process, and the freedom of contract
of sophisticated and experienced parties in a commercial environment to craft
their own contractual relations.&nbsp; I agree with Tercon that the public interest
favours an orderly and fair scheme for tendering in the construction industry,
but there is also a public interest in leaving knowledgeable parties free to
order their own commercial affairs.&nbsp; In my view, on the facts of this case, the
Court should not rewrite &#151; nor should the Court refuse to give effect to &#151; the
terms agreed to by the parties.</P>

</SPAN>I accept, as did the courts below, that the respondent Ministry
breached the terms of its own RFP when it contracted with Brentwood, knowing
the work would be carried out by a co-venture with Brentwood and EAC.&nbsp; The
addition of EAC, a bigger contractor with greater financial resources than
Brentwood, created a stronger competitor for Tercon than Brentwood alone.&nbsp;
However, I also agree with the B.C. Court of Appeal that the exclusion of
compensation clause is clear and unambiguous and that no legal ground or rule
of law permits us to override the freedom of the parties to contract (or to
decline to contract) with respect to this particular term, or to relieve Tercon
against its operation in this case.&nbsp; </P>

</SPAN>For almost three decades the law governing a structured bidding
process has been dominated by the concept of Contract A/Contract B initially
formulated in <I>The Queen in Right of Ontario v. Ron Engineering &amp;
Construction (Eastern) Ltd.</I>, [1981] 1 S.C.R. 111.&nbsp; The analysis advanced by
Estey J. in that case was that the bidding process, as defined by the terms of
the tender call, may create contractual relations (&#147;Contract A&#148;) prior in time
and quite independently of the contract that is the actual subject matter of
the bid (&#147;Contract B&#148;).&nbsp; Breach of Contract A may, depending on its terms, give
rise to contractual remedies for non-performance even if Contract B is never
entered into or, as in the present case, it is awarded to a competitor.&nbsp; The result
of this legal construct is to provide unsuccessful bidders with a <I>contractual</I>
remedy against an owner who departs from its own bidding rules.&nbsp; Contract A,
however, arises (if at all) as a matter of interpretation.&nbsp; It is not imposed
as a rule of law.</P>

</SPAN>In <I>Ron Engineering</I>, the result of Estey J.&#146;s analysis was
that as a matter of contractual interpretation, the Ontario government was
allowed to retain a $150,000 bid bond put up by Ron Engineering even though the
government was told, a little over an hour after the bids were opened, that Ron
Engineering had made a $750,058 error in the calculation of its bid and wished
to withdraw it.&nbsp; Estey J. held:</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;">The contractor was not asked to sign a contract which diverged in any way
from its tender but simply to sign a contract in accordance with the
instructions to tenderers and in conformity with its own tender. [p. 127]</P>

<DIV class="Section51">

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">In other words,
harsh as it may have seemed to Ron Engineering, the parties were held to their
bargain.&nbsp; The Court was not prepared to substitute &#147;fair and reasonable&#148; terms
for what the parties had actually agreed to.</P>

</SPAN>In <I>M.J.B. Enterprises Ltd. v. Defence Construction (1951) Ltd.</I>,
[1999] 1 S.C.R. 619, Contract A included a &#147;privilege&#148; clause which stated that
the owner was not obliged to accept the lowest or <I>any</I> tender.&nbsp; The Court
implied a term, based on the presumed intention of the parties, that
notwithstanding the privilege clause, only compliant bids were open to
acceptance.&nbsp; While the owner was not obliged to accept the lowest compliant
bid, the privilege clause did not, as a matter of contractual interpretation,
give the owner &#147;the privilege&#148; of accepting a non-compliant bid.&nbsp; <I>M.J.B.</I>
stops short of the issue in the present appeal because in that case, there was
a breach of Contract&nbsp;A but no clause purporting to exclude liability on
the part of the owner to pay compensation in the event of a Contract A violation.</P>

</SPAN>In <I>Naylor Group Inc. v. Ellis-Don Construction Ltd.</I>, 2001

system against a contractor whose bid was based on what turned out to be a
mistaken view of its collective bargaining status with the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.&nbsp; The Court again affirmed that &#147;[t]he
existence and content of Contract A will depend on the facts of the particular
case&#148; (para. 36).&nbsp; Ellis-Don sought relief from its bid on the basis of a
labour board decision rendered subsequent to its bid that upheld, to its
surprise, the bargaining rights of the union.&nbsp; This Court held that no relief
was contemplated in the circumstances under Contract A and none was afforded,
even though this was a costly result when viewed from the perspective of
Ellis-Don.</P>

</SPAN>In <I>Martel Building Ltd. v. Canada</I>, 2000 SCC 60, [2000] 2
S.C.R. 860, citing <I>M.J.B.</I>, the Court implied a term in Contract A
obligating the owner to be fair and consistent in the assessment of tender
bids.&nbsp; On the facts, the disappointed bidder&#146;s claim of unfair treatment was

</SPAN>&nbsp;Finally, in <I>Double N Earthmovers Ltd. v. Edmonton (City)</I>,
2007 SCC 3, [2007] 1 S.C.R. 116, the unsuccessful bidder claimed that Edmonton
had accepted, in breach of Contract A, a competitor&#146;s non-compliant bid to
provide heavy equipment of a certain age to move refuse at a waste disposal
site.&nbsp; The Court refused to imply a term &#147;requiring an owner to investigate to
see if bidders will really do what they promised in their tender&#148; (para. 50).&nbsp;
Accepting the existence of a duty of &#147;fairness and equality&#148;, the majority
nevertheless held that &#147;[t]he best way to make sure that all bids receive the
same treatment is for an owner to weigh bids on the basis of what is actually
in the bid, not to weigh them on the basis of subsequently discovered
information&#148; (para. 52).&nbsp; In other words, the majority&#146;s interpretation of the
express terms of Contract A was enforced despite Double N Earthmovers&#146;
complaint of double dealing by the owner.</P>

</SPAN>On the whole, therefore, while <I>Ron Engineering</I> and its

contractors to the risks posed by an exclusion of compensation clause.&nbsp; It
nevertheless chose to bid on the project on the terms proposed by the Ministry.</P>

either a statutory legal obstacle to, or a principled legal argument against,
the freedom of these parties to contract out of the obligation that would
otherwise exist for the Ministry to pay compensation for a breach of Contract
A.&nbsp; If not, the second question is whether there is any other barrier to the
court&#146;s enforcement of the exclusionary clause in the circumstances that
occurred.&nbsp; On the first branch, Tercon relies on the <I>Ministry of Transportation
and Highways Act</I>, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 311 (&#147;<I>Transportation Act</I>&#148; or the
&#147;Act&#148;).&nbsp; On the second branch, Tercon relies on the doctrine of fundamental
breach.</P>

</SPAN>Section 4 of the <I>Transportation Act </I>provides that before
awarding a highway contract, &#147;the minister must invite tenders in any manner
that will make the invitation for tenders reasonably available to the public&#148;,
but then provides for several exceptions: &#147;The minister need not invite tenders
for a project &hellip; if &hellip; (c) the minister believes that an
alternative contracting process will result in a competitively established cost
for the project&#148;.&nbsp; Here the required ministerial authorization was obtained for
an &#147;alternative process&#148;.&nbsp; The reason is as follows.&nbsp; As noted by Cromwell J.,
the Ministry&#146;s original idea was to use a &#147;design-build&#148; model where a single
contractor would design and build the highway for a fixed price.&nbsp; The Ministry
issued a request for expressions of interest (&#147;RFEI&#148;) which attracted six
responses.&nbsp; One was from Tercon.&nbsp; Another was from Brentwood.&nbsp; EAC declined to
bid because it did not think the &#147;design-build&#148; concept was appropriate for the
job.</P>

</SPAN>On further reflection, the Ministry decided not to pursue the
design-build approach.&nbsp; It decided to design the highway itself.&nbsp; The contract
would be limited to construction, as EAC had earlier advocated.&nbsp; EAC was not
allowed to bid despite the Ministry coming around to its point of view on the
proper way to tender the project.&nbsp; The Ministry limited bidding on the new
contest to the six respondents to the original RFEI, all of whom had been found
capable of performing the contract.&nbsp; But to do so, it needed, and did obtain,
the Minister&#146;s s. 4 approval. </P>

</SPAN>A question arose during the hearing of the appeal as to whether
the Minister actually approved an &#147;alternative process&#148; that not only
restricted eligibility to the six participants in the RFEI process (an
advantage to Tercon and the other five participants), but also contained the
&#147;no claims&#148; clause excluding compensation for non-observance of its terms (no
doubt considered a disadvantage).&nbsp; In its factum, the Ministry states: </P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent: 20.85pt;">In this case, the Minister approved an alternate
process under [s. 4(2) of the B.C. <I>Transportation Act</I>].&nbsp; That process

&#147;clauses limiting or excluding liability are negotiated as part of the general

the consequences of deficient performance&#148; (p. 461).&nbsp; Moreover, as Mr. Hall
points out, &#147;[t]here are many valid reasons for contracting parties to use
exemption clauses, most notably to allocate risks&#148; (G. R. Hall, <I>Canadian
Contractual Interpretation Law </I>(2007), at p. 243).&nbsp; Tercon for example is a
sophisticated and experienced contractor and if it decided that it was in its
commercial interest to proceed with the bid despite the exclusion of
compensation clause, that was its prerogative and nothing in the &#147;policy of the
Act&#148; barred the parties&#146; agreement on that point.&nbsp; </P>

now.&nbsp; Accordingly, I proceed on the basis that the exclusion clause&nbsp; did not
run afoul of the statutory requirements.</P>

fundamental breach, had forfeited the protection of the exclusion of
compensation clause. </P>

</SPAN>The leading case is <I>Hunter</I> which also dealt with an
exclusion of liability clause.&nbsp; The appellants Hunter Engineering and
Allis-Chalmers Canada Ltd. supplied gearboxes used to drive conveyor belts at
Syncrude&#146;s tar sands operations in Northern Alberta.&nbsp; The gearboxes proved to
be defective.&nbsp; At issue was a broad exclusion of warranty clause that limited
time for suit and the level of recovery available against Allis-Chalmers (i.e.
no recovery beyond the unit price of the defective products).&nbsp; Dickson C.J.
observed: &#147;In the face of the contractual provisions, Allis-Chalmers can only
be found liable under the doctrine of fundamental breach&#148; (p. 451). </P>

W.L.R. 936 (C.A.)).&nbsp; It was said to be a rule of law that operated
independently of the intention of the parties in circumstances where the
defendant had so egregiously breached the contract as to deny the plaintiff
substantially the whole of its benefit.&nbsp; In such a case, according to the
doctrine, the innocent party was excused from further performance but the
defendant could still be held liable for the consequences of its &#147;fundamental&#148;
breach even if the parties had excluded liability by clear and express
language.&nbsp; See generally S. M. Waddams, <I>The Law of Contracts</I> (5th ed.

</SPAN>Dickson C.J. (La Forest J. concurring) observed that the doctrine
of fundamental breach had &#147;spawned a host of difficulties&#148; (p. 460), the most
obvious being the difficulty in determining whether a particular breach is
fundamental.&nbsp; The doctrine obliged the parties to engage in &#147;games of
characterization&#148; (p. 460) which distracted from the real question of what
agreement the parties themselves intended.&nbsp; Accordingly, in his view, the
doctrine should be &#147;laid to rest&#148;.&nbsp; The situations in which the doctrine is
invoked could be addressed more directly and effectively through the doctrine
of &#147;unconscionability&#148;, as assessed at the time the contract was made:</P>

<DIV class="Section59">

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;">It is preferable to interpret the terms of the contract, in an attempt to
determine exactly what the parties agreed.&nbsp; If on its true construction the
contract excludes liability for the kind of breach that occurred, the party in
breach will generally be saved from liability.&nbsp; Only where the contract is
unconscionable, as might arise from situations of unequal bargaining power
between the parties, should the courts interfere with agreements the parties
have freely concluded. [p. 462]</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">Dickson C.J.
explained that &#147;[t]he courts do not blindly enforce harsh or unconscionable
bargains&#148; (p. 462), but &#147;there is much to be gained by addressing directly the
protection of the weak from over-reaching by the strong, rather than relying on
the artificial legal doctrine of &#145;fundamental breach&#146;&#148; (p. 462).&nbsp; To enforce an
exclusion clause in such circumstances could tarnish the institutional
integrity of the court.&nbsp; In that respect, it would be contrary to public
policy.&nbsp; However, a <I>valid </I>exclusion clause would be enforced according
to its terms.</P>

</SPAN>Wilson J. (L&#146;Heureux-Dub&eacute; J. concurring) disagreed.&nbsp; In her
view,&nbsp; the courts retain some residual discretion to refuse to enforce
exclusion clauses in cases of fundamental breach where the doctrine of <I>pre</I>-breach
unconscionability (favoured by Dickson C.J.) did not apply.&nbsp; Importantly, she
rejected the imposition of a general standard of reasonableness in the judicial
scrutiny of exclusion clauses, affirming that &#147;the courts . . . are quite
unsuited to assess the fairness or reasonableness of contractual provisions as
the parties negotiated them&#148; (p. 508).&nbsp; Wilson J. considered it more desirable
to develop through the common law a <I>post</I>-breach analysis seeking a
&#147;balance between the obvious desirability of allowing the parties to make their
own bargains ... and the obvious undesirability of having the courts used to
enforce bargains in favour of parties who are totally repudiating such bargains
themselves&#148; (p. 510). </P>

</SPAN>Wilson J. contemplated a two-stage test, in which the threshold
step is the identification of a fundamental breach where &#147;the foundation of the
contract has been undermined, where the very thing bargained for has not been
provided&#148; (p. 500).&nbsp; Having found a fundamental breach to exist, the exclusion
clause would <I>not</I> automatically be set aside, but the court should go on
to assess whether, having regard to the circumstances of the breach, the party
in fundamental breach should escape liability:</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;">Exclusion clauses do not automatically lose their validity in the event
of a fundamental breach by virtue of some hard and fast rule of law.&nbsp; They
should be given their natural and true construction so that the meaning and
effect of the exclusion clause the parties agreed to at the time the contract
was entered into is fully understood and appreciated.&nbsp; But, in my view, the
court must still decide, having ascertained the parties&#146; intention at the time
the contract was made, whether or not to give effect to it <U>in the context of
subsequent events such as a fundamental breach</U> committed by the party
seeking its enforcement through the courts. . . . [T]he question essentially
is: in the circumstances that have happened should the court lend its aid to A
to hold B to this clause?&nbsp; [Emphasis added; pp. 510-11.]</P>

[1980] A.C. 827 (H.L.)] may be right that parties of equal bargaining power
should be left to live with their bargains regardless of subsequent events.&nbsp; I

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">Wilson J. made
it clear that such circumstances of disentitlement would be rare.&nbsp; She acknowledged
that an exclusion clause might well be accepted with open eyes by a party &#147;very
anxious to get&#148; the contract (p. 509).&nbsp; However, Wilson J. did not elaborate

breach while nevertheless affirming (once again) that whether or not a
&#147;fundamental breach prevents the breaching party from continuing to rely on an
exclusion clause is a matter of construction rather than a rule of law&#148; (at
para. 52).&nbsp; In other words, the question was whether the parties <I>intended</I>
at the time of contract formation that the exclusion or limitation clause would
apply &#147;in circumstances of contractual breach, whether fundamental or
otherwise&#148; (para. 63).&nbsp; The Court thus emphasized that what was important was
not the label (&#147;fundamental or otherwise&#148;) but the intent of the contracting
parties when they made their bargain.&nbsp; &#147;The <U>only limitation</U> placed upon

2007 SCC 50, [2007] 3 S.C.R. 461, should be seen in that light.&nbsp; <I>Domtar </I>was
a products liability case arising under the civil law of Quebec, but the Court
observed with respect to the common law:</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent: 20.85pt;">Once the existence of a fundamental breach has been
established, the court must still analyse the limitation of liability clause in
light of the general rules of contract interpretation.&nbsp; If the words can

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify">It is the duty
of the courts to give effect to contracts and testamentary dispositions
according to the settled rules and principles of law, since we are under a

</SPAN>As Duff C.J. recognized, freedom of contract will often, but not
always, trump other societal values.&nbsp; The residual power of a court to decline
enforcement exists but, in the interest of certainty and stability of
contractual relations, it will rarely be exercised.&nbsp; Duff C.J. adopted the view
that public policy &#147;should be invoked only in clear cases in which the harm to
the public is substantially incontestable, and does not depend upon the
idiosyncratic inferences of a few judicial minds&#148; (p. 7).&nbsp; While he was
referring to public policy considerations pertaining to the nature of the <I>entire</I>
<I>contract</I>, I accept that there may be well-accepted public policy considerations
that relate directly to the nature of the <I>breach</I>, and thus trigger the

</SPAN>There are cases where the exercise of what Professor Waddams
calls the &#147;ultimate power&#148; to refuse to enforce a contract may be justified,
even in the commercial context.&nbsp; Freedom of contract, like any freedom, may be
abused.&nbsp; Take the case of the milk supplier who adulterates its baby formula
with a toxic compound to increase its profitability at the cost of sick or dead
babies.&nbsp; In China, such people were shot.&nbsp; In Canada, should the courts give
effect to a contractual clause excluding civil liability in such a situation?&nbsp;
I do not think so.&nbsp; Then there are the people, also fortunately resident elsewhere,
who recklessly sold toxic cooking oil to unsuspecting consumers, creating a
public health crisis of enormous magnitude.&nbsp; Should the courts enforce an
exclusion clause to eliminate contractual liability for the resulting losses in
such circumstances?&nbsp; The answer is no, but the contract breaker&#146;s conduct need
not rise to the level of criminality or fraud to justify a finding of abuse.</P>

Canada Ltd. v. Dow Chemical of Canada Ltd.</I>, 2004 ABCA 309, 245 D.L.R. (4th)

the defendant Dow knowingly supplied defective plastic resin to a customer who
used it to fabricate natural gas pipelines.&nbsp; Instead of disclosing its prior
knowledge of the defect to the buyer, Dow chose to try to protect itself by
relying upon limitation of liability clauses in its sales contracts.&nbsp; After
some years, the pipelines began to degrade, with considerable damage to
property and risk to human health from leaks and explosions.&nbsp; The court
concluded that &#147;a party to a contract will not be permitted to engage in
unconscionable conduct secure in the knowledge that no liability can be imposed
upon it because of an exclusionary clause&#148; (para. 53).&nbsp; (See also McCamus, at
p. 774, and Hall, at p. 243).&nbsp; What was demonstrated in <I>Plas-Tex </I>was
that the defendant Dow was so contemptuous of its contractual obligation and
reckless as to the consequences of the breach as to forfeit the assistance of
the court.&nbsp; The public policy that favours freedom of contract was outweighed
by the public policy that seeks to curb its abuse.</P>

</SPAN>Conduct approaching serious criminality or egregious fraud are

favours freedom of contract.&nbsp; Where this type of misconduct is reflected in the
breach of contract, all of the circumstances should be examined very carefully
by the court.&nbsp; Such misconduct may disable the defendant from hiding behind the
exclusion clause.&nbsp; But a plaintiff who seeks to avoid the effect of an
exclusion clause must identify the overriding public policy that it says
outweighs the public interest in the enforcement of the contract.&nbsp; In the

Court may undertake a third enquiry, namely whether the Court should
nevertheless refuse to enforce the valid exclusion clause because of the
existence of an overriding public policy, proof of which lies on the party

public interest in the enforcement of contracts.&nbsp; </P>

</SPAN>The trial judge found that the parties intended to create
contractual relations at the bidding stage (i.e. Contract A): 2006 BCSC 499, 53
B.C.L.R. (4th) 138, at para. 88.&nbsp; I agree with that conclusion.&nbsp; If there were
no intent to form Contract A, there would be no need to exclude liability for
compensation in the event of its breach.</P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm; ">[126]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</SPAN>The Ministry argued that Contract A was not breached.&nbsp; It was
entitled to enter into Contract B with Brentwood and it did so.&nbsp; There was no
privity between the Ministry and EAC.&nbsp; The Ministry would have had no direct
claim against EAC in the event of deficient performance.&nbsp; I accept as correct
that Brentwood, having obtained Contract B, was in a position of considerable
flexibility as to how and with whom it carried out the work.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it
was open to the trial judge to conclude, as she did, that the RFP process was
not conducted by the Ministry with the degree of fairness and transparency that
the terms of Contract A entitled Tercon to expect.&nbsp; At the end of an unfair
process, she found, Contract B was not awarded to Brentwood (the eligible
bidder) but to what amounted to a joint venture consisting of Brentwood and
EAC.&nbsp; I therefore proceed with the rest of the analysis on the basis that
Contract A was breached.</P>

</SPAN>It is at this stage that I part company with my colleague
Cromwell J. The exclusion clause is contained in the RFP and provides as
follows:</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

</DIV>

<SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><BR clear="all" style="page-break-before:auto">

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify"><B>2:10 </B>.

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;">Except as expressly and specifically permitted in these Instructions to
Proponents, no Proponent shall have any claim for compensation of any kind
whatsoever, as a result of participating in this RFP, and by submitting a
Proposal each Proponent shall be deemed to have agree that it has no claim.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">In my view,
&#147;participating in this RFP&#148; began with &#147;submitting a Proposal&#148; for
consideration.&nbsp; The RFP process consisted of more than the final selection of
the winning bid and Tercon participated in it.&nbsp; Tercon&#146;s bid <I>was</I>
considered.&nbsp; To deny that such participation occurred on the ground that in the
end the Ministry chose a Brentwood joint venture (ineligible) instead of
Brentwood itself (eligible) would, I believe, take the Court up the dead end
identified by Wilson J. in <I>Hunter</I>:</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;">. . . exclusion clauses, like all contractual provisions, should be given
their natural and true construction.&nbsp; Great uncertainty and needless
complications in the drafting of contracts will obviously result if courts give
exclusion clauses strained and artificial interpretations in order, indirectly
and obliquely, to avoid the impact of what seems to them <I>ex post facto</I>
to have been an unfair and unreasonable clause. [p. 509]</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">Professor
McCamus expresses a similar thought:</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;">. . . the law concerning exculpatory clauses is likely to be more rather
than less predictable if the underlying concern is openly recognized, as it is
in <I>Hunter</I>, rather than suppressed and achieved indirectly through the
subterfuge of strained interpretation of such terms.&nbsp; [p. 778]</P>

</SPAN>I accept the trial judge&#146;s view that the Ministry was at fault in
its performance of the RFP, but the conclusion that the process thereby ceased
to be the RFP process appears to me, with due respect to colleagues of a
different view, to be a &#147;strained and artificial interpretatio[n] in order,
indirectly and obliquely, to avoid the impact of what seems to them <I>ex post

</SPAN>As a matter of interpretation, I agree with Donald J.A. speaking
for the unanimous court below:</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent: 20.85pt;">The [trial] judge said the word &#147;participating&#148; was
ambiguous.&nbsp; With deference, I do not find it so.&nbsp; The sense it conveys is the
contractor&#146;s involvement in the RFP/contract A <U>stage</U> of the process.&nbsp; I
fail to see how &#147;participating&#148; could bear any other meaning.&nbsp; [Emphasis added;
para. 16.]</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">Accordingly, I
conclude that on the face of it, the exclusion clause applies to the facts
described in the evidence before us.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:18.1pt;text-align:justify;text-indent: -18.1pt;">C.&nbsp; <I>Was the Claim Excluding Compensation

</SPAN>At this point, the focus turns to contract formation.&nbsp; Tercon
advances two arguments: firstly, that it suffered from an inequality of
bargaining power and secondly, (as mentioned) that the exclusion clause
violates public policy as reflected in the <I>Transportation Act</I>. </P>

</SPAN>In <I>Hunter</I>, Dickson C.J. stated, at p. 462: &#147;Only where the
contract is unconscionable, as might arise from situations of unequal
bargaining power between the parties, should the courts interfere with
agreements the parties have freely concluded.&#148; Applying that test to the case
before him, he concluded:</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;">I have no doubt that unconscionability is not an issue in this case.&nbsp;
Both Allis-Chalmers and Syncrude are large and commercially sophisticated companies.&nbsp;
Both parties knew or should have known what they were doing and what they had
bargained for when they entered into the contract.&nbsp; [p. 464]</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">While Tercon is
not on the same level of power and authority as the Ministry, Tercon is a major
contractor and is well able to look after itself in a commercial context.&nbsp; It
need not bid if it doesn&#146;t like what is proposed.&nbsp; There was no relevant
imbalance in bargaining power.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

</SPAN>As mentioned earlier, Tercon cites and relies upon the policy of
the Act which undoubtedly favours the transparency and integrity of the bidding
process.&nbsp; I have already discussed my reasons for rejecting Tercon&#146;s argument
that this &#147;policy&#148; operates as a bar to the ability of the parties to agree on
such commonplace commercial terms as in the circumstances they think
appropriate.&nbsp; In addition, the exclusion clause is not as draconian as Tercon portrays
it. Other remedies for breach of Contract A (specific performance or injunctive
relief, for example) were available.&nbsp; </P>

</SPAN>In this case, injunction relief <I>was</I> in fact a live
possibility.&nbsp; Although Tercon was not briefed on the negotiations with other
bidders, the trial judge found that Glenn Walsh, the owner of Tercon, &#147;had seen
representatives of EAC with Brentwood following [the Brentwood/EAC interviews
with the Ministry and Bill Swain of Brentwood]&#148;, and when asked whether Tercon
was going to sue, Walsh had said &#147;no&#148; without further comment.&nbsp; Had Tercon
pushed for more information and sought an injunction (as a matter of private
law, not public law), at that stage the exclusion clause would have had no
application, but Tercon did not do so.&nbsp; This is not to say that estoppel or
waiver applies.&nbsp; Nor is it to say that injunctive relief would be readily
available in many bidding situations (although if an injunction had been sought
here, the unavailability of the alternative remedy of monetary damages might
have assisted Tercon).&nbsp; It is merely to say that the exclusion clause is
partial, not exhaustive.</P>

</SPAN>The Kincolith road project presented a serious construction
challenge on a tight time frame and within a tight budget.&nbsp; Contract A did not
involve a bid for a fixed price contract but for the right to negotiate the bid
details once the winning proponent was selected.&nbsp; In such a fluid situation, <I>all</I>
participants could expect difficulties in the contracting process.&nbsp; Members of
the construction bar are nothing if not litigious.&nbsp; In the circumstances, the
bidders might reasonably have accepted (however reluctantly) the Ministry&#146;s
need for a bidding process that excluded compensation, and adjusted their bids
accordingly.&nbsp; The taxpayers of British Columbia were not prepared to pay the
contractor&#146;s profit twice over &#151; once to Brentwood/EAC for actually building
the road, and now to Tercon, even though in Tercon&#146;s case the &#147;profit&#148; would be
gained without Tercon running the risks associated with the performance of
Contract B.&nbsp; The Court should not be quick to declare such a clause, negotiated
between savvy participants in the construction business, to be &#147;contrary to the
Act&#148;.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:18.1pt;text-align:justify;text-indent: -18.1pt;">D.&nbsp; <I>Assuming the Validity of the Exclusion Clause

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm; ">[135]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</SPAN>If the exclusion clause is not invalid from the outset, I do not
believe the Ministry&#146;s performance can be characterized as so aberrant as to
forfeit the protection of the contractual exclusion clause on the basis of some
overriding public policy.&nbsp; While there is a public interest in a fair and
transparent tendering process, it cannot be ratcheted up to defeat the
enforcement of Contract A in this case.&nbsp; There <I>was</I> an RFP process and
Tercon participated in it.</P>

</SPAN>Assertions of ineligible bidders and ineligible bids are the
bread and butter of construction litigation.&nbsp; If a claim to defeat the exclusion
clause succeeds here on the basis that the owner selected a joint venture
consisting of an eligible bidder with an ineligible bidder, so also by a parity
of reasoning should an exclusion clause be set aside if the owner accepted a
bid ineligible on other grounds.&nbsp; There would be little room left for the
exclusion clause to operate.&nbsp; A more sensible and realistic view is that the
parties here expected, even if they didn&#146;t like it, that the exclusion of
compensation clause would operate even where the eligibility criteria in
respect of the bid (including the bidder) were not complied with.</P>

conduct was not so extreme as to engage some overriding and paramount public
interest in curbing contractual abuse as in the <I>Plas-Tex</I> case.&nbsp;
Brentwood was not an outsider to the RFP process.&nbsp; It was a legitimate
competitor.&nbsp; All bidders knew that the road contract (i.e. Contract B) would
not be performed by the proponent alone.&nbsp; The work required a large &#147;team&#148; of
different trades and personnel to perform.&nbsp; The issue was whether EAC would be
on the job as a major sub-contractor (to which Tercon could not have objected)
or identified with Brentwood as a joint venture &#147;proponent&#148; with EAC.&nbsp; All
bidders were made aware of a certain flexibility with respect to the
composition of any proponent&#146;s &#147;team&#148;.&nbsp; Section 2.8(b) of the RFP provided that
if &#147;a material change has occurred to the Proponent since its qualification
under the RFEI, including if the composition of the Proponent&#146;s team members
has changed, . . . the Ministry may request [further information and] . . .
reserves the right to disqualify that Proponent, and reject its Proposal&#148;.&nbsp;
Equally, &#147;[i]f a qualified Proponent is concerned that it has undergone a
material change, the Proponent can, at its election, make a preliminary
submission to the Ministry, in advance of the Closing Date, and before
submitting a Proposal. . . . The Ministry will, within three working days of
receipt of the preliminary submission give a written decision as to whether the
Proponent is still qualified to submit a Proposal.&#148;</P>

perspective, the change was desirable.&nbsp; EAC was a bigger company, had greater
expertise in rock drilling and blasting (a major part of the contract) and a stronger
balance sheet.&nbsp; EAC was identified in Brentwood&#146;s amended proposal as a
sub-contractor.&nbsp; In the end, the Ministry did not approve the January 14, 2001
request, presumably because it doubted that a change in the &#147;composition of the
Proponent&#146;s team&#146;s members&#148; could , according to the terms of the RFP, include

</SPAN>The Ministry did obtain legal advice and did not proceed in
defiance of it.&nbsp; On March 29, 2001, the Ministry noted in an internal e-mail
that a Ministry lawyer (identified in the e-mail) had come to the conclusion
that the joint venture was not an eligible proponent but advised that Contract
B could lawfully be structured in a way so as to satisfy both Brentwood/EAC&#146;s
