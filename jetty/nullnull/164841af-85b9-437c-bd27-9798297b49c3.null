<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">C, a criminal defence lawyer employed by Yukon Legal
Aid, represented an accused charged with sexual offences against a young
child.&nbsp; Prior to the preliminary inquiry, Legal Aid informed the accused that
failure to update his financial information would result in the suspension of his
legal aid funding.&nbsp; The accused failed to respond to the request and Legal Aid
informed him that C was no longer authorized to represent him.&nbsp; C brought an
application to the Territorial Court of Yukon to withdraw as counsel of record
solely because of the suspended funding.&nbsp; However, C indicated that she was
willing to represent the accused if funding were reinstated.&nbsp; The Territorial
Court refused her application.&nbsp; The Supreme Court of the Yukon Territory
dismissed C&#146;s application for an order in the nature of <I>certiorari</I>
seeking to quash the Territorial Court&#146;s order, holding that the Territorial
Court did not exceed its jurisdiction.&nbsp; The Court of Appeal allowed C&#146;s appeal
on the basis that the Territorial Court had no discretion to refuse C&#146;s
application to withdraw.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">The Territorial Court had jurisdiction to refuse to
grant C&#146;s request to withdraw.&nbsp; A court has the authority to require counsel to
continue to represent an accused when the reason for withdrawal is non&#8209;payment
of fees, but the authority must be exercised sparingly and only when necessary
to prevent serious harm to the administration of justice.&nbsp; Superior courts
possess inherent jurisdiction to ensure they can function as courts of law and
fulfil their mandate to administer justice.&nbsp; Likewise, in the case of statutory
courts, the authority to control their process and oversee the conduct of
counsel is necessarily implied in the grant of power to function as a court of
law.</P>

<DIV class="Section5">

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">Disclosure of non&#8209;payment of fees in cases where
it is unrelated to the merits and will not prejudice an accused does not
attract the protection of the solicitor&#8209;client privilege, and the remote
possibility that a judge will inappropriately attempt to elicit privileged
information in hearing the application to withdraw does not justify leaving the
decision to withdraw exclusively to counsel.&nbsp; As well, the oversight of a
lawyer&#146;s withdrawal does not fall exclusively to the law societies.&nbsp; Both the
courts and the law societies play different, but important, roles in regulating
withdrawal: the courts prevent harm to the administration of justice and the
law societies discipline lawyers whose conduct falls below professional
standards.&nbsp; These roles are not mutually exclusive; rather, they are necessary
to ensure the effective regulation of the profession and protect the process of
the court.&nbsp; While counsel&#146;s personal or professional interests may be in
tension with an individual client&#146;s interest, courts must presume that lawyers
act ethically.&nbsp; Where the court requires counsel to continue to represent an
accused, counsel must do so competently and diligently.&nbsp; Both the integrity of
the profession and the administration of justice require nothing less.&nbsp; Lastly,
a <I>Rowbotham</I> order might be relevant to the court&#146;s residual discretion
to refuse withdrawal, but it cannot operate as a replacement for it.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">The court&#146;s exercise of discretion to decide counsel&#146;s
application for withdrawal should be guided by the following principles.&nbsp; If
counsel seeks to withdraw far enough in advance of any scheduled proceedings
and an adjournment will not be necessary, the court should allow the
withdrawal.&nbsp; If timing is an issue, the court is entitled to enquire into counsel&#146;s
reasons.&nbsp; In either the case of ethical reasons or non&#8209;payment of fees,
the court must accept counsel&#146;s answer at face value and not enquire further so
as to avoid trenching on potential issues of solicitor&#8209;client privilege.&nbsp;
If withdrawal is sought for an ethical reason, the court must grant withdrawal;
if it is sought because of non&#8209;payment of legal fees, the court may
exercise its discretion to refuse counsel&#146;s request if it determines, after
weighing all the relevant factors, that allowing withdrawal would cause serious
harm to the administration of justice. </P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">Refusing an application to withdraw is a coercive and
conclusive order with respect to the lawyer and, in that context, an order in
the nature of <I>certiorari</I> should be given its normal scope and can be
allowed where there is an error of jurisdiction or an error of law on the face
of the record. </P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">In this case, the Supreme Court of the Yukon Territory
correctly concluded that the Territorial Court had the jurisdiction to refuse
to grant counsel&#146;s request to withdraw.&nbsp; The question of whether this case
satisfies the high threshold that must be met to refuse leave to withdraw is
now moot and the record before this Court does not provide information on
several of the relevant factors.&nbsp; It is, therefore, not clear whether the
circumstances of this case would, after full analysis of the relevant
considerations, justify a refusal of leave to withdraw.</P>

</SPAN>Jennie Cunningham is a criminal defence lawyer employed by the Yukon
Legal Services Society (&#147;Legal Aid&#148;).&nbsp; She represented Clinton Lance Morgan,
who was charged with three sexual offences against a young child.&nbsp; Mr. Morgan&#146;s
preliminary inquiry was set for June 26, 2006.&nbsp; The Crown had advised that it

</SPAN>On May 3, 2006, Legal Aid informed Mr. Morgan that he had to update his
financial information, which he had previously provided to Legal Aid, and that
failure to do so would result in the suspension of his Legal Aid funding.&nbsp; By
May 16, 2006, Mr. Morgan had failed to respond to the request and Legal Aid
informed him that his counsel, Ms. Cunningham, was no longer authorized to
represent him.&nbsp; Ms. Cunningham promptly brought an application to the
Territorial Court of Yukon to withdraw as counsel of record.&nbsp; The sole reason
for the application was the suspension of Legal Aid funding and Mr. Morgan&#146;s
inability to otherwise pay for legal services.&nbsp; Ms. Cunningham indicated that
she was willing to continue to represent Mr. Morgan if his Legal Aid funding
was reinstated.</P>

</SPAN>Lilles Terr. Ct. J. heard Ms. Cunningham&#146;s application to withdraw.&nbsp; He
refused to grant her application to withdraw because: a) legal aid funding
could potentially be reinstated and Ms. Cunningham was willing to continue in
the event that it was; b) the charges against Mr. Morgan were very serious; c)
there was a young child complainant whose memory, emotional and psychological
well-being may have been affected by further delay; d) counsel would have to be
appointed to cross-examine the child complainant; e) there was no information
on the potential for Mr. Morgan to obtain other representation; f) there was no
information on when the preliminary inquiry could be rescheduled if withdrawal
was allowed; g) while a preliminary inquiry is not as critical as a trial, it
is still important to how the trial is conducted; h) there was a hotly
contested and difficult issue regarding videotape evidence that would be
difficult for Mr. Morgan to deal with as a self-represented litigant; and i)
further delay would prejudice Mr. Morgan as he was labelled as a potential
sexual offender as a result of the criminal charges (para. 26).</P>

</SPAN>The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, finding that Lilles Terr. Ct. J.
had no discretion to refuse withdrawal.&nbsp; It reached its conclusion on the basis
of three factors.&nbsp; First, the law society has the primary interest in lawyer
regulation and court oversight of withdrawal could create a conflict between
the court&#146;s decision and any disciplinary decision by a law society.&nbsp; Second,
the court&#146;s supervision of withdrawal potentially threatens solicitor-client
privilege in cases where counsel is asked to disclose the reasons for wishing
to withdraw.&nbsp; Third, compelled representation puts counsel in the position of a
perceived or actual conflict between the client&#146;s best interest and the
lawyer&#146;s interest in ending the matter as quickly as possible.&nbsp; It determined
the better approach to withdrawal was to rely on the assumption that lawyers
generally do not avoid their professional obligations and, if they do, then the
law societies will take appropriate disciplinary action.&nbsp; The court
acknowledged, however, that a court could use its contempt power &#147;in extreme
circumstances where a lawyer&#146;s conduct in connection with a withdrawal amounted
to a serious affront to the administration of justice&#148; (para. 29).&nbsp; The court

</SPAN>The issue in the present appeal is whether, in a criminal matter, a
court has the authority to refuse to grant defence counsel&#146;s request to
withdraw because the accused has not complied with the financial terms of the
retainer.&nbsp; The reasons use the phrase &#147;non-payment of legal fees&#148; to refer to
situations where, for example, an accused has actually defaulted on payment,
where an accused has failed to provide funds on account at the agreed upon
time, or where a legal aid certificate has been suspended or revoked. </P>

</SPAN>An accused has an unfettered right to discharge his or her legal counsel
at any time and for any reason.&nbsp; A court may not interfere with this decision
and cannot force counsel upon an unwilling accused (see <I>Vescio v. The King</I>,
[1949] S.C.R. 139, at p. 144; though exceptionally the court may appoint an <I>amicus
curiae</I> to assist the court).&nbsp; Counsel, on the other hand, does not have an
unfettered right to withdraw.&nbsp; The fiduciary nature of the solicitor-client
relationship means that counsel is constrained in his or her ability to
withdraw from a case once he or she has chosen to represent an accused.&nbsp; These
constraints are thoroughly outlined in the rules of professional conduct issued
by the provincial or territorial law societies (e.g. Law Society of Yukon, <I>Code
of Professional Conduct</I>, Part One, r. 21; Law Society of Alberta, <I>Code
of Professional Conduct</I> (updated 2009), cc. 2, 6-7; Law Society of British
Columbia, <I>Professional Conduct Handbook</I> (updated 2010), c. 10; Law
Society of Upper Canada, <I>Rules of Professional Conduct</I> (updated 2009),
r. 2).&nbsp; This appeal raises the issue of whether a court&#146;s jurisdiction to
control its own process imposes a further constraint on counsel&#146;s ability to
withdraw.</P>

</SPAN>&nbsp;There are two lines of provincial and territorial appellate court
reasoning on this issue.&nbsp; The British Columbia and Yukon Courts of Appeal have
determined that a court has no authority to prevent criminal defence counsel
from withdrawing for non-payment of legal fees.&nbsp; The Alberta, Saskatchewan,
Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec Courts of Appeal have taken the opposite position
&#151; a court may refuse counsel&#146;s request to withdraw.&nbsp; Trial courts in New
Brunswick and Newfoundland have also followed this line of authority.</P>

</SPAN>The British Columbia and Yukon position stems from the British Columbia
Supreme Court decision in <I>Re Leask and Cronin</I> (1985), 18 C.C.C. (3d)
315.&nbsp; In <I>Leask</I>, the court, on an application for an order in the nature
of prohibition, found that a provincial court judge has no right in law to
order counsel to continue to represent an accused.&nbsp; McKay J. found that this
conclusion recognized the role of a strong and independent bar and that the
role of disciplining lawyers is vested in the law societies, not the court.&nbsp; He
found that the relationship between a solicitor and client is a contractual one
and that once the client breaches the contract, the solicitor is entitled to
repudiate and bring the contract to an end.&nbsp; McKay J. was also concerned about
potential infringements of solicitor-client privilege, which he thought may
arise if counsel must disclose the reasons for withdrawal.&nbsp; Although lawyers
may ask for leave, McKay J. found this was a matter of &#147;politeness and
courtesy&#148; (p. 325), the court having no discretionary power to refuse.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>

</SPAN>I would note that the issue in <I>Leask </I>did not arise from non-payment
of fees, like the present appeal, but rather from a breakdown in the
solicitor-client relationship. Nonetheless, subsequent British Columbia
jurisprudence has relied on <I>Leask</I> as a basis for finding that the court
is not empowered to refuse counsel&#146;s request to withdraw for any reason (see
also <I>Luchka v. Zens</I> (1989), 37 B.C.L.R. (2d) 127 (C.A.), at p. 129, <I>R.

</SPAN>In contrast, the Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec
Courts of Appeal as well as their trial courts, and trial courts in New
Brunswick and Newfoundland, have all accepted that a court has the authority to
refuse counsel&#146;s application for withdrawal.&nbsp; The Alberta Court of Appeal&#146;s
decision in <I>R. v. C. (D.D.) </I>(1996), 110 C.C.C. (3d) 323, leave to appeal
refused, [1997] 1 S.C.R. vii (<I>sub nom. Ferguson v. The Queen</I>), has
received the most attention.&nbsp; In <I>C. (D.D.)</I>, the Alberta Court of Appeal
determined that in addition to counsel&#146;s contractual obligations to the client,
a lawyer is also an officer of the court.&nbsp; It is in this capacity that counsel
owes a duty to the court to &#147;attend before a judge when requested&#148; and &#147;not to
walk out on a client in the middle of a trial&#148; (p. 327).&nbsp; So long as counsel
has not expressed that he or she appears on a limited retainer, the court may
refuse to grant a request to withdraw.&nbsp; </P>

</SPAN>The Alberta Court of Appeal appears to recognize two limitations to the
court&#146;s discretion.&nbsp; First, the court <I>must</I> grant a withdrawal request
when there is a breakdown in the solicitor-client relationship (p. 328).&nbsp;
Second, where counsel seeks to withdraw for non-payment of fees, the court <I>may</I>
permit withdrawal after considering harm to the Crown&#146;s case, inconvenience to
witnesses, and whether the allotted court time could be filled with other
business (p. 330).&nbsp; </P>

</SPAN>The Manitoba Court of Appeal has also considered the court&#146;s power to
refuse counsel&#146;s request to withdraw for non-payment of fees: <I>R. v.
Deschamps</I>, 2003 MBCA 116, 177 Man. R. (2d) 301.&nbsp; It agreed with the Alberta
Court of Appeal that a court has the authority to refuse withdrawal.&nbsp; However,
Steel J.A. determined that the assessment should be based on whether allowing
withdrawal would cause prejudice to the accused and to the administration of
justice (para. 24).&nbsp; </P>

</SPAN>Superior courts possess inherent jurisdiction to ensure they can
function as courts of law and fulfil their mandate to administer justice (see&nbsp;
I. H. Jacob, &#147;The Inherent Jurisdiction of the Court&#148; (1970), 23 <I>Curr. Legal
Probs.</I> 23, at pp. 27-28).&nbsp; Inherent jurisdiction includes the authority to
control the process of the court, prevent abuses of process, and ensure the
machinery of the court functions in an orderly and effective manner.&nbsp; As
counsel are key actors in the administration of justice, the court has
authority to exercise some control over counsel when necessary to protect its
process. In<I> MacDonald Estate v. Martin</I>,<I> </I>[1990] 3 S.C.R. 1235,
this Court confirmed that inherent jurisdiction includes the authority to
remove counsel from a case when required to ensure a fair trial:</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify">The courts,
which have inherent jurisdiction to remove from the record solicitors who have
a conflict of interest, are not bound to apply a code of ethics.&nbsp; Their
jurisdiction stems from the fact that lawyers are officers of the court and
their conduct in legal proceedings which may affect the administration of
justice is subject to this supervisory jurisdiction. [p. 1245]</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">It would seem to
follow that just as the court, in the exercise of its inherent jurisdiction,
may remove counsel from the record, it also may refuse to grant counsel&#146;s
application for withdrawal.&nbsp; </P>

</SPAN>Likewise in the case of statutory courts, the authority to control the
court&#146;s process and oversee the conduct of counsel is necessarily implied in
the grant of power to function as a court of law.&nbsp; This Court has affirmed that
courts can apply a &#147;doctrine of jurisdiction by necessary implication&#148; when
determining the powers of a statutory tribunal:</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify">. . . the
powers conferred by an enabling statute are construed to include not only those
expressly granted but also, by implication, all powers which are practically
necessary for the accomplishment of the object intended to be secured by the
statutory regime . . . . </P>

</SPAN>The more contentious issue in this appeal is whether a criminal court
may exercise its inherent or necessarily implied jurisdiction to control its
own process by overseeing lawyer withdrawal.&nbsp; </P>

</SPAN>The reasons in favour of courts exercising this jurisdiction are
numerous.&nbsp; An accused, who becomes unable to pay his lawyer, may be prejudiced
if he is abandoned by counsel in the midst of criminal proceedings.&nbsp;
Proceedings may need to be adjourned to allow the accused to obtain new
counsel.&nbsp; This delay may prejudice the accused, who is stigmatized by the
unresolved criminal charges and who may be in custody awaiting trial.&nbsp; It may
also prejudice the Crown&#146;s case.&nbsp; Additional delay also affects complainants,
witnesses and jurors involved in the matter, and society&#146;s interest in the
expedient administration of justice. Where these types of interests are
engaged, they may outweigh counsel&#146;s interest in withdrawing from a matter in
which he or she is not being paid.</P>

</SPAN>On the other hand, Ms. Cunningham and the interveners taking the same
position say a court must <I>always</I> decline to exercise this jurisdiction.&nbsp;
Collectively, they support their position with the three main factors relied on
by the Court of Appeal: solicitor-client privilege, the role of law societies and
conflict of interest.&nbsp; In addition, they also direct the Court&#146;s attention to <I>Rowbotham
</I>orders as a potential solution.&nbsp; Their position is that the proper approach
is for a court to presume that lawyers act ethically and that any professional
transgressions are best addressed by the law society. In exceptional cases,
however, Ms. Cunningham and the Law Society of Yukon say that the contempt
power would be available to a court where counsel seeks to withdraw for an
improper purpose or where the manner of withdrawal warrants a citation for
contempt.&nbsp; The Canadian Bar Association and the Criminal Lawyers&#146; Association
state that there must be clear evidence of a breach of an ethical standard or
an abuse of process for a court to cite counsel for contempt.</P>

</SPAN>Ms. Cunningham and the interveners argue that solicitor-client privilege
could be violated in one of two ways: simply by disclosure of the mere fact
that the accused has not paid his or her fees, or inadvertent disclosure of
privileged information when engaging in a discussion with the court about the
reasons for withdrawal.</P>

</SPAN>Concern regarding the protection of solicitor-client privilege is
warranted.&nbsp; It need hardly be said that solicitor-client privilege is a
fundamental tenet of our legal system.&nbsp; The solicitor-client relationship is
integral to the administration of justice;&nbsp; privilege encourages the free and
full disclosure by the client required to ensure effective legal representation
(see <I>Smith v. Jones</I>, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 455, at para. 45, <I>per </I>Cory
J. for the majority, and <I>R. v. McClure</I>, 2001 SCC 14, [2001] 1 S.C.R.

</SPAN>However, revealing that an accused has not paid his or her fees does not
normally touch on the<I> rationale</I> for solicitor-client privilege in the
criminal context.&nbsp; A client must be able to rely on the confidentiality of the
communications made between lawyer and client because only then can there be
full and frank discussion of the facts of the case, and the giving and
receiving of soundly based legal advice (see <I>Anderson v. Bank of British
Columbia </I>(1876), 2 Ch. D. 644 (C.A.), at p. 649; relied on in <I>Smith v.
Jones</I>, at para. 45, and <I>McClure</I>, at para. 32).&nbsp; There has been no
explanation as to why an accused would be any more inclined to withhold
information from counsel, where the court has discretion over withdrawal, than
where counsel can unilaterally withdraw.</P>

</SPAN>&nbsp;In arguing that disclosure of the mere fact that an accused has not
paid or will not be paying his or her legal fees is protected by
solicitor-client privilege, the Law Societies of British Columbia and Yukon
rely on this Court&#146;s decisions in <I>Desc&ocirc;teaux v. Mierzwinski</I>, [1982] 1
S.C.R. 860, and <I>Maranda v. Richer</I>, 2003 SCC 67, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 193,
where this Court held that, in the context of a law office search, an accused&#146;s
financial and fee information may be privileged.&nbsp; In <I>Maranda</I>, the Court
was concerned that fee information, specifically the amount of fees and
disbursements, may appear to be &#147;neutral&#148; when in fact disclosure of the
information could be prejudicial to the accused.&nbsp; In particular, LeBel J.
stated that fee information</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;">might enable an intelligent investigator to reconstruct some of the
client&#146;s comings and goings, and to assemble evidence concerning his presence
at various locations based on the documentation relating to his meetings with
his lawyer. [para. 24]</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">This information
could then be used to charge and/or convict the client.&nbsp; Because of the
potentially detrimental effect of disclosure on the client, fee information is

information is <I>in fact </I>privileged is made by the court, not the
police.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>

</SPAN>Counsel seeking to withdraw for non-payment of legal fees is a decidedly
different context from a police search of counsel&#146;s accounts and records.&nbsp; The
most significant difference is the content of the information being disclosed.&nbsp;
The only information revealed by counsel seeking to withdraw is the sliver of
information that the accused has not paid or will not be paying fees.&nbsp; It has
not been explained how, in this case, this sliver of information could be
prejudicial to the accused.&nbsp; Indeed, it is hard to see how this simple fact
alone could be used against the accused on the merits of the criminal
proceeding: it is unrelated to the information given by the client to the
lawyer, and unrelated to the advice given by the lawyer to the client.&nbsp; It
would not be possible to infer from the bare fact of non-payment of fees any
particular activities of the accused that pertain to the criminal charges
against him.&nbsp; </P>

</SPAN>To be sure, this is the case where non-payment of fees is not linked to
the merits of the matter and disclosure of non-payment will not cause prejudice
to the accused.&nbsp; However, in other legal contexts, payment or non-payment of
fees may be relevant to the merits of the case, for example, in a family law
dispute where support payments are at issue and a client is alleging inability
to pay.&nbsp; Or disclosure of non-payment of fees may cause prejudice to the
client, for example, where the opposing party may be prompted to bring a motion
for security for costs after finding out that the other party is unable to pay
its legal fees.&nbsp; Where payment or non-payment of fees is relevant to the merits
of the case, or disclosure of such information may cause prejudice to the
client, solicitor-client privilege may attach.</P>

</SPAN>Disclosure of non-payment of fees in cases where it is unrelated to the
merits and will not cause prejudice to the accused is not an exception to
privilege, such as the innocence at stake or public safety exceptions (see
generally <I>McClure</I> and<I> Smith v. Jones</I>).&nbsp; Rather, non-payment of
legal fees in this context does not attract the protection of solicitor-client
privilege in the first place.&nbsp; However, nothing in these reasons, which address
the application, or non-application, of solicitor-client privilege in
disclosures to a court, should be taken as affecting counsel&#146;s ethical duty of
confidentiality with respect to payment or non-payment of fees in other
contexts.</P>

</SPAN>In the alternative, Ms. Cunningham and the interveners argue that
counsel may inadvertently disclose privileged information when explaining the
reasons for withdrawing and answering questions from the judge.&nbsp; They argue
that this risk is so unacceptable that it requires the court to decline to
exercise any discretion to refuse counsel&#146;s request to withdraw.&nbsp; They point to
<I>Leask</I> where counsel sought withdrawal due to irreconcilable differences
between counsel and the accused. The provincial court judge wanted specific
details to determine if the differences could be resolved (<I>Leask</I>, at pp.
318-19).&nbsp; The accused in <I>Leask</I> was drawn into the conversation with the
judge as well.&nbsp; They argue that this is dangerous because the accused may
unknowingly waive his or her right to privilege and disclose information that
is otherwise protected. </P>

</SPAN>I agree that the exchange initiated by the provincial court judge in <I>Leask</I>
was inappropriate.&nbsp; The judge repeatedly pressed counsel for detailed reasons
for withdrawal, and continued to press even when counsel attempted to rely on
the professional rules of conduct.&nbsp; The judge bluntly asked the accused if he
objected to counsel disclosing the specific reason for withdrawal.&nbsp; I think it
is fair to say that what occurred in <I>Leask</I>&nbsp;was unacceptable.&nbsp; </P>

S.C.R. 656, at p. 664, <I>per</I> McLachlin J. (as she then was)).&nbsp;&nbsp; The
integrity of the administration of justice rests on these assumptions.&nbsp;
Delicate matters frequently come before courts.&nbsp; For example, although the
initial decision not to produce a potentially privileged document is that of
counsel, a judge may have to decide whether the document is in fact
privileged.&nbsp; The remote possibility of inadvertent disclosure in the course of
that proceeding does not mean that the ultimate decision must be left solely to
counsel in disputed cases.&nbsp; I am of the view that the same is true with respect
to withdrawal for non-payment of legal fees in criminal matters.&nbsp; The remote
possibility that a judge will inappropriately attempt to elicit privileged
information in hearing the application does not justify leaving the decision to
withdraw exclusively to counsel.</P>

</SPAN>I am also unable to accept the argument of Ms. Cunningham and the

unprofessional conduct; however, the purpose of the court overseeing withdrawal

</SPAN>The Canadian Bar Association also offers guidance on professional
conduct.&nbsp; Its rule on withdrawal states:</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify">The lawyer

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;">Failure on the part of the client after reasonable notice to provide

These standards complement the court&#146;s discretion to refuse withdrawal where
the effects on the administration of justice will be severe.&nbsp; For example, the
Canadian Bar Association rules recognize the distinct, yet complementary,
nature of the functions served by the court and law societies:</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;">Where withdrawal is required or permitted by this Rule the lawyer must

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">Both the courts

standards.&nbsp; They are not mutually exclusive.</P>

</SPAN>Ms. Cunningham and the interveners submit that court supervision over
withdrawal threatens the independence of the bar.&nbsp; As I note above, lawyers are
intimately involved in the administration of justice.&nbsp; I do not agree that an
exceptional constraint on counsel, necessary to protect the integrity of the
administration of justice, threatens counsel&#146;s independence.&nbsp; For instance,
McLachlin J. in <I>Young v. Young</I>, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 3, at pp. 135-36,
acknowledged that a court can award costs against counsel personally in rare
cases where counsel acts in bad faith by encouraging abuse and delay of the
court&#146;s process.&nbsp; There is no suggestion that this rare constraint has
threatened the independence of the bar.&nbsp; Furthermore, court oversight of lawyer
withdrawal has been the practice in Alberta at least since the decision in <I>C.
(D.D.)</I> in 1996.&nbsp; There is no suggestion that this practice affects the
independence of the Alberta bar.&nbsp; Finally, all law society rules recognize that
an independent bar has obligations beyond those owed to clients.&nbsp; Lawyers must
comply with their professional obligations to the administration of justice and
the public; these obligations do not undermine counsel&#146;s independence (see, for
example: Law Society of Yukon, Parts Two and Three; Law Society of Upper
Canada, rr. 4 and 6; Law Society of Alberta, c. 1; Law Society of British
Columbia, c. 1).</P>

</SPAN>I am also unpersuaded by the Law Society of British Columbia&#146;s point
that forcing unwilling counsel to continue may create a conflict between the
client&#146;s and lawyer&#146;s interests.&nbsp; It is argued that where counsel is compelled
to work for free, he or she may be tempted to give legal advice which will
expedite the process in order to cut counsel&#146;s financial losses even though
wrapping up a criminal matter as quickly as possible may not be in the best
interests of the accused.&nbsp; This argument, however, is inconsistent with the Law
Society&#146;s position &#151; with which I agree &#151; that the court should presume that
lawyers act ethically.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many situations where counsel&#146;s personal or
professional interests may be in tension with an individual client&#146;s interest,
for example where counsel acquires an interesting new file that requires
immediate attention, or has vacation plans that conflict with the timing of court
proceedings affecting the client.&nbsp; Counsel is obligated to be diligent,
thorough and to act in the client&#146;s best interest.&nbsp; Similarly, if counsel
agrees to be retained <I>pro bono</I>, he or she must act just as
professionally as if acting for the client on a paid retainer of the same
nature.&nbsp; Where the court requires counsel to continue to represent an accused,
counsel must do so competently and diligently.&nbsp; Both the integrity of the
profession and the administration of justice require nothing less.</P>

</I>order is intended to ensure that an accused receives a fair trial; it does
not account for the interests of any other party or person affected by the
proceeding.&nbsp; Thus, if delay in the proceedings or the affect on others is the
determinative factor in an application for withdrawal for non-payment of fees,
a <I>Rowbotham</I> order does nothing to address this concern and may even
exacerbate it.&nbsp; A <I>Rowbotham </I>order requires a separate motion where an
accused must satisfy rigorous criteria in order to succeed.&nbsp; A <I>Rowbotham</I>

withdrawal, but it cannot operate as a replacement to it.</P>

</SPAN>Assuming that timing is an issue, the court is entitled to enquire
further.&nbsp; Counsel may reveal that he or she seeks to withdraw for ethical
reasons, non-payment of fees, or another specific reason (e.g. workload of
counsel) if solicitor-client privilege is not engaged.&nbsp; Counsel seeking to
withdraw for ethical reasons means that an issue has arisen in the
solicitor-client relationship where it is now impossible for counsel to
continue in good conscience to represent the accused.&nbsp; Counsel may cite
&#147;ethical reasons&#148; as the reason for withdrawal if, for example, the accused is
requesting that counsel act in violation of his or her professional obligations
(see, e.g., Law Society of Upper Canada, r. 2.09(7)(b), (d); Law Society of
Alberta, c. 14, r. 2; Law Society of British Columbia, c. 10, r. 1), or if the
accused refuses to accept counsel&#146;s advice on an important trial issue (see,
e.g., Law Society of Upper Canada, r. 2.09(2); Law Society of Alberta, c. 14,
r. 1; Law Society of British Columbia, c. 10, r. 2).&nbsp; If the real reason for
withdrawal is non-payment of legal fees, then counsel cannot represent to the
court that he or she seeks to withdraw for &#147;ethical reasons&#148;.&nbsp; However, in
either the case of ethical reasons or non-payment of fees, the court must

to withdraw in order to comply with his or her professional obligations.&nbsp; It
would be inappropriate for a court to require counsel to continue to act when
to do so would put him or her in violation of professional responsibilities.</P>

repeatedly.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">As these factors
are all independent of the solicitor-client relationship, there is no risk of
violating solicitor-client privilege when engaging in this analysis.&nbsp; On the
basis of these factors, the court must determine whether allowing withdrawal
would cause serious harm to the administration of justice.&nbsp; If the answer is
yes, withdrawal may be refused.&nbsp; </P>

</SPAN>Harm to the administration of justice is not simply administrative
inconvenience as the interveners suggest.&nbsp; Harm to the administration of
justice recognizes that there are other persons affected by ongoing and
prolonged criminal proceedings: complainants, witnesses, jurors and society at
large.&nbsp; Because of this, I would respectfully observe that the consideration
suggested by the Alberta Court of Appeal in <I>C. (D.D.)</I> of whether
allotted court time can be otherwise usefully filled is not a relevant
consideration in this balancing of interests. </P>

</SPAN>The Manitoba Court of Appeal&#146;s decision in <I>Deschamps</I> offers a
useful example of the appropriate exercise of the court&#146;s discretion.&nbsp; Defence
counsel was representing the offender in a dangerous offender proceeding.&nbsp; Five
days into the proceeding counsel requested an adjournment to allow the offender
to be assessed for and receive treatment.&nbsp; The matter was remanded for
approximately eight months.&nbsp; During this time difficulties arose with legal aid
funding.&nbsp; Because the dangerous offender proceedings were of high complexity,
counsel was initially promised a higher fee than provided by the regular
tariff.&nbsp; &#147;Financial difficulties&#148; called into question Legal Aid&#146;s ability to
follow through with the commitment to a higher fee.&nbsp; Defence counsel sought to
withdraw due to Legal Aid&#146;s alleged breach of contract.</P>

</SPAN>The motions judge determined that there was no breach of contract.&nbsp;
However, she found that even if there had been a breach, she would have refused
counsel&#146;s request to withdraw.&nbsp; In the Court of Appeal, Steel J.A. upheld this
decision.&nbsp; She agreed with the motions judge that the factors relevant to
denying withdrawal were: the proceeding was serious and complex, the offender
could not represent himself, the proceeding had already begun, there was no immediate
prospect of obtaining another lawyer, and the offender was a difficult client
who had finally developed a relationship of trust and confidence with this
particular counsel.&nbsp; The Court of Appeal agreed with the motions judge that
further delay would have resulted from allowing withdrawal and would have
caused serious prejudice to the offender.&nbsp; The Court of Appeal noted that after
the initial motion, Legal Aid ensured that fees would still be paid, just not
at the higher rate.&nbsp; Counsel&#146;s application to withdraw was refused.</P>

</SPAN>The question of whether this case meets the high threshold that must be
met to refuse leave to withdraw is now moot.&nbsp; The parties and the judge did not
have the benefit of these reasons, and the record before this Court does not
provide information or analysis on several of the relevant factors.&nbsp; It is,
therefore, not clear whether the circumstances of this case would, after full
analysis of the relevant factors, justify a refusal of leave to withdraw.&nbsp; I
simply emphasize that the threshold for refusing leave to withdraw is a high
one and requires a proper basis in the record for its exercise.</P>

</SPAN>This appeal originated in the Supreme Court of the Yukon Territory as an
unsuccessful application for an order in the nature of <I>certiorari</I>.&nbsp; Ms.
Cunningham had to apply for <I>certiorari</I> because there is no provision in
the <I>Criminal Code</I> providing for interlocutory appeals (see s. 674 of the
<I>Criminal Code</I>).&nbsp; Once the superior court heard the application, Ms.
Cunningham appealed to the Court of Appeal (s. 784(1) of the <I>Criminal Code</I>)
and the Crown in turn to the Supreme Court of Canada (s. 40 of the <I>Supreme
Court Act</I>, R.S.C. 1985, c. S-26). </P>

</SPAN>There is some question as to how the matter would have proceeded had it
originated in a superior court.&nbsp; Both the Alberta and Manitoba Courts of Appeal
have found that they do not have jurisdiction over appeals of withdrawal
applications from superior courts (<I>C. (D.D.)</I>,<I> </I>at p. 330, <I>Deschamps</I>,
at para. 42).&nbsp; While this Court need not decide the correct procedure for
appealing a withdrawal application originating in a superior court, some
guidance might be useful.&nbsp; These circumstances seem to be analogous to those in
<I>Dagenais v. Canadian Broadcasting Corp</I>., [1994] 3 S.C.R. 835.&nbsp; <I>Dagenais</I>
involved a media challenge of a publication ban in a criminal matter.&nbsp; As the
media was a third party to the criminal proceedings, the Court determined that
this was different than an interlocutory appeal by a party to the action.&nbsp; It
concluded that the least undesirable route of appeal was directly from the
superior court to the Supreme Court of Canada through s. 40 of the <I>Supreme
Court Act</I> (p. 862).&nbsp; Similarly, defence counsel is a third party to the
main criminal action, so it appears this would be analogous to <I>Dagenais</I>.

</SPAN>Orders in the nature of <I>certiorari</I> may only be granted where the
inferior court has made a jurisdictional error or an error of law on the face
of the record (G. L&eacute;tourneau, <I>The Prerogative Writs in Canadian Criminal Law
and Procedure</I> (1976),&nbsp; at p. 143).&nbsp; Gower J. thought he had to find an
excess of jurisdiction to interfere with Lilles Terr. Ct. J.&#146;s exercise of
discretion.&nbsp; However, excess of jurisdiction is the standard for a preliminary
inquiry judge&#146;s decision to either commit an accused to trial or issue a
discharge (<I>Patterson v. The Queen</I>, [1970] S.C.R. 409, at p. 413; <I>Dubois
v. The Queen</I>, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 366, at p. 380; <I>R. v. Deschamplain</I>,
2004 SCC 76, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 601, at para. 17).&nbsp; This high threshold for review
is premised on the fact that a preliminary inquiry does not result in a final
determination of guilt or innocence; therefore, there is less need for broad
supervisory remedies (<I>Dubois</I>,<I> </I>at pp. 373-74).&nbsp; However, a lawyer
seeking withdrawal is not analogous to a committal or discharge at a
preliminary inquiry; it is more closely analogous to <I>Dagenais</I>, a
third-party application. The judge at first instance has the authority to make
an immediate and final determination on counsel&#146;s application to withdraw.&nbsp; As
noted by Steel J.A. in <I>Deschamps</I>, refusing an application to withdraw is
a coercive and conclusive order with respect to the lawyer (para. 38).&nbsp;
Therefore, in this context an order in the nature of <I>certiorari</I> should
be given its normal scope and can be allowed where there is an error of
jurisdiction or an error of law on the face of the record (<I>Dagenais</I>, at
pp. 864-65). </P>

</SPAN>Because the authority to supervise the conduct of counsel falls within
the inherent or necessarily implied jurisdiction of the court, it is difficult
to see how a decision to refuse withdrawal could amount to a jurisdictional
error.&nbsp; However, it would be open for counsel to argue that the provincial or
territorial court judge committed an error of law on the face of the record.&nbsp;
Such errors would include, for example, refusing withdrawal when counsel seeks
to withdraw for ethical reasons, or failing to consider a relevant factor when
exercising discretion over withdrawal for non-payment of fees (see <I>R. v.
Gardiner</I>, 2008 ONCA 397, 231 C.C.C. (3d) 394, at para. 26, and <I>Ottawa
Citizen Group Inc. v. R.</I> (2005), 75 O.R. (3d) 590, at para. 49).</P>

</SPAN>In sum, a court has the authority to control its own process and to
supervise counsel who are officers of the court.&nbsp; The Supreme Court of the
Yukon Territory correctly concluded that the Territorial Court had the
jurisdiction to refuse to grant counsel&#146;s request to withdraw.&nbsp; This
jurisdiction, however, should be exercised exceedingly sparingly.&nbsp; It is not
appropriate for the court to refuse withdrawal where an adjournment will not be
necessary, nor where counsel seeks withdrawal for ethical reasons.&nbsp; Where
counsel seeks untimely withdrawal for non-payment of fees, the court must weigh
the relevant factors and determine whether withdrawal would cause serious harm
to the administration of justice.</P>
