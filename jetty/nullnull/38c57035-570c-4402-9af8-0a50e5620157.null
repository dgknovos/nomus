<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">The accused, a Lieutenant&#8209;Colonel in the Canadian
military, had an argument with his wife.&nbsp; The wife took the mounted diploma
which the accused had earned for his Master&#146;s degree off the wall and threw it
on the floor.&nbsp; The accused then pushed her and she fell backwards onto the
staircase, bruising her back, legs and elbow.&nbsp; The next day, she learned that
her finger was broken.&nbsp; The accused was charged with assault causing bodily
harm and tried by a Standing Court Martial.&nbsp; The accused and wife testified,
and the military judge accepted the wife&#146;s testimony that she fell as a result
of being pushed or shoved by the accused.&nbsp; The accused conceded that he
intentionally applied force to his wife without her consent, but argued that
under s.&nbsp;39(1) of the <I>Criminal Code</I> the assaultive behaviour was
justified because he was protecting his personal property, namely, the
diploma.&nbsp; The military judge found that the accused used more force than was
necessary in defence of his personal property and, therefore, that the
s.&nbsp;39(1) defence could not serve to justify his actions.&nbsp; The accused was
convicted of the lesser and included offence of assault.&nbsp; The majority of the
Court Martial Appeal Court upheld his conviction.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;"><I>Held</I> (Binnie and Fish JJ.

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;"><I>Per</I> McLachlin C.J. and
LeBel, Deschamps, <B>Abella</B> and Rothstein JJ.:&nbsp; The military judge took
great care to discuss what he understood reasonable doubt to mean, and there is
nothing in his comments to suggest that he either misappreciated or misapplied
the proper approach simply because he failed to specifically refer to the three
steps of the proper legal test.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">The military judge did not err in his application of
s.&nbsp;39(1) of the <I>Code</I>.&nbsp; In interpreting the phrase &#147;no more force
than is necessary&#148; in s.&nbsp;39(1), an inquiry should be made into whether the
force used was &#147;reasonable in all the circumstances&#148;.&nbsp; The reasonableness of
&#147;all the circumstances&#148; necessarily includes the accused&#146;s subjective belief as
to the nature of the danger or harm.&nbsp; It also includes an objective component,
which requires that the subjective belief be based on reasonable grounds.&nbsp; In
this case, the military judge did exactly what he was required to do: he
determined whether the accused had used no more force than was necessary to
defend his possession in all the circumstances based on both subjective and
objective criteria.&nbsp; He accepted the sentimental value of the diploma from the
accused&#146;s perspective, and considered the risk of harm to which the diploma had
been exposed by the wife&#146;s throwing it on the floor. He also took into account
the fact that the diploma was replaceable, the nature of the force used by the
accused, the accused&#146;s admission that he may have gone too far in the anger of
the moment, and the wife&#146;s extensive bruises.&nbsp; The military judge concluded
that the accused lost his self&#8209;control for a short period of time during
which he &#147;physically manhandled&#148; his spouse causing her to fall and suffer
injuries.&nbsp; The military judge found the use of such force in the circumstances
to be disproportionate. This conclusion is eminently justified based on the
legal and factual contexts.</P>

<DIV class="Section5">

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;"><I>Per</I> <B>Binnie</B> and
Fish JJ. (dissenting):&nbsp; In this case, the military judge&#146;s reasons fell short
of the standard of adequacy set out in <I>R. v. R.E.M.</I>, 2008 SCC 51, [2008]
3 S.C.R. 3, because they do not explain the basis on which it could be said
beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused used more force than was necessary.&nbsp;
The military judge did cover the &#147;what&#148; of the case &#151; the finding that the use
of force was excessive &#151; but he was also required to go further and describe
&#147;why&#148; he reached the conclusion that he did.&nbsp; His reasons do not disclose to

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">The altercation took place on a small (3 feet by 3 feet)
landing on the stairs of the home.&nbsp; The accused did not intervene until the
wife caused a second framed article to fall down the stairs and smash and
showed no sign of stopping.&nbsp; He then descended the stairs &#147;to get her off the
diploma&#148;.&nbsp; The military judge concluded that the wife had suffered bruising,
but this does not itself show that the force was excessive in the sense of
disproportionate to what was &#147;necessary&#148;.&nbsp; While the state of the wife&#146;s
injuries was relevant to that determination, if the military judge believed
that the injuries were themselves sufficient evidence of excess he should have
said so and the proposition could then be tested on appeal.&nbsp; The military
judge also assigned considerable weight to the accused&#146;s submission that he
acted in the anger of the moment, but it is quite possible that the accused
could meet the &#147;no more force than was necessary&#148; standard despite the fact
that he acted in anger.&nbsp; Again, if the military judge thought otherwise, he
should have said so.&nbsp; The military judge used the evocative and pejorative word
&#147;manhandle&#148; but the word simply means to &#147;handle (a person) roughly&#148; or to
&#147;pull or hustle about&#148; and the accused was entitled to use the level of force
reasonably necessary to protect his property.&nbsp; There are circumstances where a
push might be justified.&nbsp; If in the military judge&#146;s view a push could never be
justified, such a categorical principle ought to have been stated and would
then be capable of appellate review.</P>

she used no more force than is necessary.&nbsp; </P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">(2009 CMAC 4, [2009] C.M.A.J. No. 4 (QL), at para. 52)</P>

</SPAN>As in most trials involving domestic disputes, the spouses in this case
offered differing versions of the same event.&nbsp; After hearing and watching both
of them, the trial judge reached his own conclusions about what actually
happened and convicted the husband of assault.&nbsp; Those conclusions were based on
the facts and impressions he considered to be most relevant and reliable.&nbsp; In
the absence of any palpable and overriding error in his appreciation of them,
it is not open to an appellate court to sift selectively through the record and
substitute its own narrative and outcome: <I>R. v. R.E.M.</I>, 2008 SCC 51,
[2008] 3 S.C.R. 3, at para. 56. Seeing no error either in the trial judge&#146;s
appreciation of the facts or in his application of the relevant law, a majority
in the appeal court dismissed the husband&#146;s appeal.&nbsp; Based on the record and
the trial judge&#146;s reasons,&nbsp; I agree with this disposition. <I>&nbsp;&nbsp;</I>&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>

</SPAN>Gary Szczerbaniwicz was a Lieutenant&#8209;Colonel in the Canadian
military who was posted to NATO in Brussels.&nbsp; After he and his wife separated
following a 30-year&nbsp; marriage, Ms. Szczerbaniwicz moved to Canada, but had
returned for a brief trip to Belgium.&nbsp; LCol Szczerbaniwicz invited her to stay
overnight at the house they had formerly occupied together.</P>

</SPAN>The factual matrix for the case, according to the findings of the trial
judge, is as follows.&nbsp; The morning after her arrival, the couple had a
conversation about moving Ms. Szczerbaniwicz&#146;s personal effects from storage in
Winnipeg to the home in British Columbia that she was then occupying with their
son.&nbsp; The conversation became heated over the issue of who would pack up her possessions.&nbsp;
In the course of the argument, Ms. Szczerbaniwicz took a mounted diploma off
the wall at the landing of the staircase, and threw it on the floor.&nbsp; LCol
Szczerbaniwicz then pushed her.&nbsp; There is no reference to a second&nbsp; picture
anywhere in the trial judge&#146;s reasons except when he is summarizing LCol.
Szczerbaniwicz&#146;s version of events.&nbsp; Ms. Szczerbaniwicz fell backwards and
landed on her elbow.&nbsp; She had bruising on her back, legs and elbow.&nbsp; The next
day, a friend took her to a medical facility where she learned that her finger
was also broken.&nbsp; Her arm was in a cast for a week. </P>

</SPAN>LCol Szczerbaniwicz was charged&nbsp; with assault causing bodily harm.&nbsp; At

J.P.J.Y. Girard.</P>

</SPAN>LCol Szczerbaniwicz&#146;s evidence was that he &#147;swung&#148; his wife around &#147;to
get her off the diploma&#148;.&nbsp; He denied that his wife fell and had no explanation
for her extensive bruises.&nbsp; The trial judge did not accept LCol&nbsp;&nbsp;
Szczerbaniwicz&#146;s version of&nbsp; the circumstances surrounding the fall, preferring
the evidence of his wife. As a result, he concluded that LCol Szczerbaniwicz
had pushed or shoved her ;&nbsp; that this pushing had caused her to fall backwards
onto the staircase; that as a result of this fall she had experienced bruising
to her back, legs, and elbow; and that LCol Szczerbaniwicz had lost his self&#8209;control
and &#147;physically manhandled his spouse&#148; (2008 CM 2008 (CanLII), at
paras.16-18).&nbsp; This was based on the following assessment of her and her
husband&#146;s evidence: </P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify">I was
impressed with the manner in which Mrs Szczerbaniwicz gave her evidence, but I
am mindful of the limited importance that can ordinarily be attached to the
demeanour of a witness.&nbsp; However, Mrs Szczerbaniwicz gave her evidence in a
remarkably straightforward manner, without any apparent malice toward her
husband, and without embellishment or exaggeration.&nbsp; She readily admitted to
some facts that might be thought to reflect poorly on her own behaviour.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:113.0pt;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify">On the whole,
I find that both witnesses were attempting to give the court their best
recollection of the events.&nbsp; For the most part, I consider that the
discrepancies in the versions they give are likely attributable to the
heightened state of emotions on both sides that were in play on the morning of
16 August. [paras. 11-12]</P>

</SPAN>LCol Szczerbaniwicz conceded that he intentionally applied force to his
wife without her consent, and that he knew she was not consenting to the
application of force.&nbsp; There was, therefore, according to Lamont M.J.,&nbsp; &#147;no
doubt that even accepting all of [the husband&#146;s] evidence&#148;, the elements of the
offence of assault were made out (para. 13).</P>

</SPAN>LCol Szczerbaniwicz argued that under s. 39(1) of the <I>Criminal Code</I>,&nbsp;
the assaultive behaviour was justified because he was protecting personal
property, namely, the diploma (for a Master&#146;s Degree in Leadership and Training
from Royal Roads University).&nbsp; The trial judge found that there was an air of
reality to this defence because he was satisfied that &#147;the accused was in
peaceable possession of the diploma and that his actions in assaulting his
spouse were motivated by his desire to protect his personal property&#148;
(para.15).&nbsp; The &#147;real issue&#148;, therefore, was &#147;whether in so doing, he used no
more force than was necessary to defend his possession&#148; (para. 15).</P>

</SPAN>Lamont M.J. found LCol Szczerbaniwicz guilty of the lesser included
offence of assault.&nbsp; He accepted that the diploma was &#147;very important&#148; to LCol
Szczerbaniwicz since it &#147;signified a major achievement for him in his
professional development&#148; (para. 17), but ultimately concluded that the defence
under s. 39(1) was not made out for the following reasons:&nbsp; </P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify">. . . I have
considered several factors, including the nature of the property in question;
its value, including its sentimental value to the accused; the risk of harm to
which the property was exposed by the actions of the complainant; the
alternative courses of action open to the accused at the time; and the
consequences for the complainant of the action the accused took.&nbsp; With respect
to the matter of the action taken by the accused, <U>I accept the
uncontradicted evidence of the complainant that she suffered the bruising she
described in her evidence to her back, her legs, and her elbow.&nbsp; I find,
therefore, that she did indeed fall as a result of the pushing or shoving by
the accused in the manner she described in her testimony.&nbsp; I do not accept the
evidence of the accused in which he denies that the complainant fell. </U>&nbsp;On
his version of events, there is no explanation as to how the bruising
occurred.&nbsp; This objective fact of the bruising is consistent with the evidence
of the complainant on this point, and inconsistent with the version of events
given by Lieutenant-Colonel Szczerbaniwicz.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent: 20.85pt">I accept the evidence of Lieutenant-Colonel Szczerbaniwicz that the
diploma was very important to him as it signified a major achievement for him
in his professional development.&nbsp; But <U>there is no evidence before me that
the diploma was in fact damaged to any significant degree as a result of being
thrown to the floor, and perhaps jumped on.</U>&nbsp; Even if there were damage, the
item in question is a document that <U>might be replaced if necessary</U>.&nbsp; In
his statement to the investigators, the accused was specifically asked whether
he had gone a bit too far, and replied in reference to the diploma, &#147;It is hard
to say.&nbsp; When I think of it in retrospect, it is just a piece of paper, but it
meant a lot to me.&nbsp; It was the anger of the moment.&nbsp; If I had been even a
little bit &#150; I should have just said, I can replace that, if she breaks that.&nbsp;
But I didn&#146;t.&nbsp; That is in retrospect.&#148;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent: 20.85pt">I am urged by counsel to consider this statement as simply an
expression of regret and not as an admission that the force used was
excessive.&nbsp; But in my view, this evidence, taken in the context of the evidence
as a whole, supports the conclusion that <U>as a result of his angry state of
mind, Lieutenant-Colonel Szczerbaniwicz lost his self-control for a short
period of time, during which he physically manhandled his spouse, causing her
to fall and suffer the bruising injury I have described.</U></P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent: 20.85pt">On all the circumstances I am persuaded that the accused used
excessive force against the complainant in the purported defence of his
personal property; that is, that he used more force than was necessary, &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;and
therefore the defence under subsection 39 (1) does not serve to justify his
actions. [Emphasis added; paras. 16-19.]</P>

not find that the trial judge placed a burden on the accused to explain how the
Complainant had been bruised.&nbsp; Instead, the trial judge was simply explaining
his reason for disbelieving the evidence of the accused that the Complainant
had not fallen.&nbsp; That is, the fact of the bruising was consistent with the
evidence of the Complainant that she had fallen. [para. 25]</P>

</SPAN>The trial judge took great care to discuss what he understood reasonable
doubt to mean, and there is nothing in his comments to suggest that he either
misappreciated or misapplied the proper approach simply because he failed to
articulate or specifically follow the three steps.&nbsp; This Court has frequently
confirmed that it is the substance of<I> </I>that test that must be respected,
not its literal tripartite incarnation.&nbsp; On reading the trial judge&#146;s reasons,
there is no doubt in my mind that the proper reasoning was followed by Lamont

</SPAN>On the second issue, Blanchard C.J. was satisfied that the trial judge
took the appropriate facts and factors into account in considering both the
nature of the force applied and the circumstances surrounding the use of
force.&nbsp; In his dissenting reasons, Lutfy J.A. was of the view that while
objective factors &#147;can be relevant&#148;, the &#147;primary focus&#148; is on whether the
accused &#147;reacted with more force that he on reasonable grounds believed was
necessary&#148;.&nbsp; It is this failure to emphasize the subjective component of the
defence that is the focus of LCol Szczerbaniwicz&#146;s argument that the trial
judge erred in his approach to s. 39(1).</P>

other provisions, most of which use similar or identical language to the phrase
&#147;no more force than is necessary&#148; found in s. 39(1).&nbsp; Nothing in the language

</SPAN>The unhappy events at issue in this appeal transpired after the
appellant and his wife had been married for 30 years.&nbsp; In August 2006 they were
in the process of separating and arranging to move Mrs. Szczerbaniwicz&#146;s
household effects from Brussels to British Columbia.&nbsp; A domestic row broke out
on the morning of August 16.&nbsp; One thing lead to another until Mrs.
Szczerbaniwicz, standing on the small landing on the way up the main staircase
of their house, angrily removed from the wall a university diploma recently
earned by the appellant and threw it to the floor.&nbsp; The diploma was much valued
by the appellant as a symbol of his accomplishment.&nbsp; The argument continued.&nbsp;
Mrs. Szczerbaniwicz then intentionally flicked another framed picture off the
wall and it fell down the stairs.&nbsp; The appellant descended the stairs from the
upper landing and attempted to &#147;sw[i]ng her around to get her off the
diploma&#148;.&nbsp; The narrow point at trial was whether in doing so he used no more
force than was necessary to &#147;defend&#148; his personal property within the meaning
of s. 39(1) of the <I>Criminal Code</I>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, which reads:</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.35pt;text-align:justify;text-indent: 14.65pt;"><B>39. </B>(1) Everyone who is in peaceable
possession of personal property under a claim of right, and every one acting
under his authority, is protected from criminal responsibility for defending
that possession, even against a person entitled by law to possession of it, if
he uses no more force than is necessary.</P>

</SPAN>The appellant&#146;s position is that the military judge&#146;s reasons do not
explain any basis on which it could be said beyond a reasonable doubt that he
used more force than was necessary.&nbsp; In argument his counsel put the point this
way:</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.35pt;text-align:justify">It is perhaps
the <U>main point that the judge failed to address the central issue</U> <U>as
to whether the circumstances justified the force used to protect his property
and whether that force was excessive.</U>&nbsp; This is put very succinctly by
Justice Lutfy in paragraph 68, where he says:</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:72.0pt;text-align:justify">The military
judge did not <U>explain</U> how the pushing or shoving was itself an excessive
amount of force, either objectively or subjectively.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">The sufficiency
of the reasons is not a freestanding ground of appeal but is an issue
interwoven with the appellant&#146;s argument on s. 39(1).&nbsp; The appellant is
entitled to know why the defence was rejected.&nbsp; The appellant cites the recent
decision of our Court in <I>R. v. R.E.M.</I>, 2008 SCC 51, [2008] 3 S.C.R. 3,
in which it was held unanimously that reasons for judgment &#147;must be sufficient
to fulfill their functions of explaining <U>why</U> the accused was convicted
or acquitted, providing public accountability and permitting effective
appellate review&#148; (para. 15 (emphasis added)).&nbsp; In my view the military judge&#146;s
reasons in this case fell short of that standard.&nbsp; With respect, I therefore

attempting to give the court their best recollection of the events&#148; and that
&#147;the discrepancies in the versions they g[a]ve are likely attributable to the
heightened state of emotions on both sides that were in play on the morning of
the 16 August&#148; (2008 CM 2008 (CanLII), at para. 12).&nbsp; He accepted the wife&#146;s

</SPAN>There is no doubt that the appellant applied a measure of physical force
to Mrs. Szczerbaniwicz without her consent but the question for the court under
s. 39(1) was whether the Crown had established beyond a reasonable doubt that
the degree of force exceeded what was reasonably necessary in the circumstances
described by Mrs. Szczerbaniwicz herself as follows:</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.35pt;text-align:justify;">. . . we just continued to argue. . . .&nbsp; He started to go up the stairs

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">Mrs.
Szczerbaniwicz said that she was standing on &#147;a little landing&#148; (A.R., at p.
60) measuring about 3 feet by 3 feet (A.R., at pp. 81-82).&nbsp; After she threw
down the diploma, the appellant, she says, was upstairs and yelling and had
&#147;raised his fist&#148; and Mrs. Szczerbaniwicz said to him, &#147;&#145;Go ahead, hit me if
you want to, Gary&#146;.&nbsp; And he just went, &#145;humph&#146;&#148; (A.R., at p. 61) and she then
went to a framed picture (also hanging on the landing wall) </P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.35pt;text-align:justify;">And I flicked the corner of it, and it fell down the stairs behind and
smashed.&nbsp; Like, the glass smashed and the frame broke, and then</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">i.e. <I>after</I>
Mrs. Szczerbaniwicz had &#147;flicked&#148; down the <I>second</I> framed print</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.35pt;text-align:justify;">Gary came charging down the stairs at me and just &#151; I don&#146;t know how &#151; I
don&#146;t know how, if he grabbed me or how he did it, but he basically turned me
around and pushed me up the stairs. . . . [A.R., at p. 61]</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">Mrs.
Szczerbaniwicz acknowledged that her ongoing attack on his property &#147;was
intentional on [her] part&#148; (A.R., at p. 81) and that when he came down the
stairs, it seems, &#147;[t]here wasn&#146;t enough space&#148; for both people on the landing
(A.R., at p. 81).</P>

</SPAN>The military judge concluded from her evidence that she had suffered
bruising on her back, legs and elbow but the fact that Mrs. Szczerbaniwicz had
some bruises after falling on the staircase does not itself show that the force
was excessive in the sense of disproportionate to what was &#147;necessary&#148;.&nbsp; We
were advised by counsel that some photographs were taken of Mrs.
Szczerbaniwicz&#146;s bruises.&nbsp; The photographs were disclosed to the defence.&nbsp;
Neither the prosecution nor the defence put the photographs in evidence at
trial or sought to do so on appeal.</P>

</SPAN>If &#147;the deficiencies in the reasons prevent meaningful appellate review
of the correctness of the decision&#148; then reversible error may result (<I>R. v.
Sheppard</I>, 2002 SCC 26, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 869, at para. 28).&nbsp; This is
precisely the difficulty here identified by the appellant&#146;s counsel:</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.35pt;text-align:justify">. . . my
friend [the Crown] has said that there were alternatives and that the trial
judge had these in mind, that a person could be moved with greater or lesser
levels of force and he should not have pushed her that hard.&nbsp; <U>The problem is
that the trial judge didn&#146;t say anything about this.</U>&nbsp; This is an area that
is not covered at all in the judgment and that Justice Lutfy [dissenting in the
court below] focussed on; that <U>he [the military judge] didn&#146;t address the
circumstances of the encounter on the stairs</U>, that&#146;s the problem, and
that&#146;s why the alternatives were not canvassed at all. </P>

</SPAN>Section 39(1) is intended to protect individuals who act in defence of
their personal property provided they use no more force than is reasonably
&#147;necessary&#148;.&nbsp; What is necessary must not be disproportionate to the injury or
harm it is intended to prevent.&nbsp; The accused must have a subjective belief of
the necessity, and the belief must be based on reasonable grounds:&nbsp; <I>R. v.
Weare </I>(1983), 56 N.S.R. (2d) 411 (C.A.), at paras. 16-18, and<I> R. v.
Little</I> (1998), 122 C.C.C. (3d) 364 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 14.</P>

</SPAN>Of course, the appellant&#146;s use of force against Mrs. Szczerbaniwicz was
both morally objectionable and deeply unfortunate, as was fully recognized in
retrospect by the appellant himself, but the issue here is one of criminality.&nbsp;
The law says that the appellant was entitled to go to the defence of his
property.&nbsp; The legal question before the military judge was whether the
appellant was justified under s. 39(1) in using the measure of force that he
did.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm; ">[35]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</SPAN>The prosecution accepts that the appellant was acting in defence of
property that was of considerable sentimental importance to him, as Mrs.
Szczerbaniwicz fully appreciated at the time.&nbsp; The cases are clear that in
these sort of &#147;quick response&#148; situations an accused is not expected to &#147;weigh
to a nicety&#148; the exact measure of a defensive action or to stop and reflect upon
the precise risk of consequences from such action: <I>R. v. Baxter</I> (1975),
27 C.C.C. 2d 96 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 111; <I>R. v. Kandola</I> (1993), 80 C.C.C.

</SPAN>The military judge found that Mrs. Szczerbaniwicz fell because she was
pushed and that as a result of the fall on a hard-surfaced staircase she
suffered injuries.&nbsp; Mrs. Szczerbaniwicz says she weighed about 160 pounds and
her husband 170-180 pounds (A.R., at p. 84).&nbsp; She was occupying the existing
space while &#147;angrily&#148; taking frames off the wall one after the other and
throwing or &#147;flicking&#148; them to the floor.&nbsp; It is not clear how many remained.&nbsp;
The Crown asked the appellant in cross-examination about &#147;picture frames&#148; and
the appellant replied that they were &#147;kind of following the stair line.&nbsp; The
top one would be at the landing level and the next one would have been a little
bit down&#148; (A.R., at p. 133).&nbsp; In any event, Mrs. Szczerbaniwicz did not suggest
in her evidence that she was about to stop voluntarily.&nbsp; The appellant&#146;s
intervention in defence of his property necessarily involved a physical scuffle
of two people on a landing that only had room for one person.&nbsp; The military
judge does not question the necessity of the appellant&#146;s intervention. </P>

</SPAN>In his reasons, the military judge did cover what <I>R.E.M. </I>labels
the &#147;what&#148; of the case, i.e. the finding that the use of force was excessive,
but he was required by the jurisprudence to go further and describe the &#147;why&#148;
he reached the conclusion that he did:</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.35pt;text-align:justify;text-indent: 14.65pt">These purposes are fulfilled if the reasons, read in context, show why
the judge decided as he or she did.&nbsp; The object is not to show how the judge
arrived at his or her conclusion, in a &#147;watch me think&#148; fashion.&nbsp; It is rather
to show why the judge made that decision. . . . Doherty J.A. in <I>Morrissey</I>,
at p. 525, puts it this way: &#147;In giving reasons for judgment, the trial judge
is attempting to tell the parties <U>what</U> he or she has decided and <U>why</U>
he or she made that decision&#148; (emphasis added).&nbsp; What is required is a logical
connection between the &#147;what&#148; &#151; the verdict &#151; and the &#147;why&#148; &#151; the basis for the
verdict. [Underlining in original; italics deleted.]</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">In my view the
military judge&#146;s reasons do not disclose to the appellant or to the appellate
court the &#147;logical connection&#148; between the &#147;what&#148; and the &#147;why&#148;.&nbsp; As earlier

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.35pt;text-align:justify;">I am satisfied that the accused was in peaceable possession of the
diploma and that his actions in assaulting his spouse were motivated by his
desire to protect his personal property.&nbsp; To my mind, the real issue here is
whether in so doing, he used no more force than was necessary to defend his
possession. [para. 15]</P>

</SPAN>Lutfy J.A., dissenting in the court below, concluded that the military
judge had impermissibly &#147;reasoned backwards&#148; from the injury to a finding of
excessive force (2009 CMAC 4 (CanLII), at para. 69), citing <I>R. v. Spence</I>
(1995), 134 Sask. R. 152 (C.A.), at para. 5; <I>R. v. C.J.O.</I>, [2005] O.J.
5006 (QL) (S.C.J.), at para. 27, <I>per</I> Tulloch J.: &#147;. . . when conducting
the analysis of whether the force was reasonable in the circumstances,
reasoning backward from the nature of the injuries is an error . . .&#148;; <I>R. v.
Brown</I>, [2005] O.J. No. 2951 (QL) (S.C.J.), at para. 17, <I>per</I> Durno
J.: &#147;. . . it would have been wrong for the trial judge to look at the
consequences or injuries he accepted the complainant received, and reason back
that the force was excessive . . .&#148;; <I>R. v. Oakoak</I>, 2008 NUCJ 16
(CanLII), at para. 49, <I>per</I> Johnson J.: &#147; . . . it is improper to
determine the degree of force used by looking at the end result and then
reasoning backwards.&#148;&nbsp; Of course the state of Mrs. Szczerbaniwicz&#146;s injuries
was relevant to the determination, but if the military judge believed the
injuries were themselves sufficient evidence of &#147;excess&#148; he should have said so
and the proposition could then be tested on appeal. </P>

</SPAN>The military judge assigned considerable weight to the appellant&#146;s
admission to investigators that he acted in &#147;the anger of the moment&#148; (para.
17).&nbsp; His contrition did him credit but the legal question before the courts
was: did the appellant use no more force than was reasonably necessary?&nbsp; It is
quite possible that the appellant could meet that standard despite the fact
that he acted in &#147;the anger of the moment&#148;.&nbsp; If the military judge thought
otherwise he should have said so.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.35pt;text-align:justify;">. . . as a result of his angry state of mind, Lieutenant-Colonel
Szczerbaniwicz lost his self-control for a short period of time, during which
he physically manhandled his spouse, causing her to fall and suffer the
bruising injury I have described. [para. 18]</P>

</SPAN>The word &#147;manhandle&#148;, of course, is an evocative and pejorative term.&nbsp;
In its definition, most favourable to the prosecution, it means to &#147;handle (a
person) roughly: pull or hustle about&#148; (<I>Shorter Oxford English Dictionary on
Historical Principles </I>(6th ed. 2007), vol. 1, p. 1696).&nbsp; This, too, is of
little assistance because the appellant was entitled to use the level of force <I>reasonably
necessary</I> to protect his property.&nbsp; If the level of force required to get
her to stop the harm to his property was to &#147;pull&#148; or &#147;push&#148; her, it was not a
criminal offence for him to do so.&nbsp; If in the judge&#146;s view a push could <I>never</I>
be justified, such a categorical approach ought to have been stated and would
then be capable of appellate review.</P>

at the moment of the push: had it slid out of danger or was it in Mrs.
Szczerbaniwicz&#146;s hands or under her feet?&nbsp; The fact that after the event it was
more or less undamaged does not mean the force used was excessive: not only is
it possible that the lack of damage was purely fortuitous but the evidence does

he descended the stairs to protect it.&nbsp; I believe that the appellant was
