<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">The RCMP received a tip about an intoxicated driver
which led to a high speed pursuit of the accused.&nbsp; When the accused&#146;s car finally
came to a stop, the police had to remove him forcibly.&nbsp; He resisted.&nbsp; One
officer, C, punched him twice in the head while wrestling him out of the car.&nbsp;
Once the accused was out of the car, he continued to resist.&nbsp; C yelled at the
accused to stop resisting and gave him a third hard punch in the head.&nbsp; The
accused was pinned face down on the pavement with C straddling his back and
another officer kneeling on his thigh.&nbsp; He refused to offer up his hands to be
handcuffed, so a second officer, D, punched him twice in the back, breaking the
accused&#146;s ribs, which ultimately led to a punctured lung.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">At the police detachment following the arrest, the
accused provided breath samples that placed him over the legal blood alcohol
limit.&nbsp; The officers did not report the force they had used during the arrest
and provided little to no information about the incident.&nbsp; The accused had no
obvious signs of injury and did not expressly request medical assistance and no
attempts were made to ensure that the accused received medical attention.&nbsp; He,
however, twice told an officer that he was hurt.&nbsp; As well, he was observed
crying, was heard to say that he could not breathe, and was observed leaning
over and moaning.&nbsp; The accused was released the following morning and checked
himself into a hospital.&nbsp; He was found to have suffered broken ribs and a
collapsed lung that required emergency surgery.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">The accused entered a guilty plea to charges of impaired
driving and flight from police.&nbsp; At sentencing, the trial judge held that the
police had used excessive force in arresting the accused and breached his
rights<I>, inter alia,</I> under s.&nbsp;7 of the <I>Canadian Charter of Rights
and Freedoms</I>.&nbsp; As a remedy under s.&nbsp;24(1) of the <I>Charter</I>, he
reduced the accused&#146;s sentence below what he otherwise would have imposed and
he ordered a 12&#8209;month conditional discharge on each count, served
concurrently, with a one&#8209;year driving prohibition. </P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">The majority of the Court of Appeal held there was
sufficient evidence to support the trial judge&#146;s conclusion that the officers
used excessive force in breach of s.&nbsp;7 and upheld the decision to grant
reduced sentences under s.&nbsp;24(1).&nbsp; They added, however, that a sentencing
judge has no discretion to reduce a sentence below a statutorily mandated minimum
sentence.&nbsp; The majority thus set aside the conditional discharge on the
impaired driving offence, entered a conviction, and ordered the minimum fine
for a first offence mandated by s.&nbsp;255(1) of the <I>Criminal Code</I>.&nbsp;
They did not interfere with the conditional discharge for the offence of
evading a police officer.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">While police officers may have to resort to force in
order to complete an arrest or to prevent an offender from escaping their
custody, the allowable degree of force is constrained by the principles of
proportionality, necessity and reasonableness.&nbsp; Under s.&nbsp;25(1) of the<I>
Criminal Code</I>, the use of force to effect a lawful arrest is justified if
the police officer believes on reasonable and probable grounds that it is
necessary and if only as much force as necessary is used.&nbsp; Further, under
s.&nbsp;25(3), force intended or likely to cause death or grievous bodily harm
is prohibited unless the officer has an objectively reasonable belief that the
amount of force used is necessary for self&#8209;protection or for the
protection of another person.&nbsp; In this case, the Court of Appeal did not err in
upholding the trial judge&#146;s findings that the police used excessive force and
breached s.&nbsp;7 of the <I>Charter</I>.&nbsp; The accused was pinned beneath C at
the time of D&#146;s punches which were forceful enough to break two of the
accused&#146;s ribs.&nbsp; D did admit at the sentencing hearing that he did not believe
that C&#146;s third punch was necessary.&nbsp; The arresting officers&#146; failed to report
the extent of the accused&#146;s injuries and failed to ensure that he received
medical attention.&nbsp; Their conduct was a substantial interference with the
accused&#146;s physical and psychological integrity and security of the person.&nbsp; The
breach of the accused&#146;s s.&nbsp;7 rights was not in accordance with any
principle of fundamental justice.</P>

<DIV class="Section7">

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">As regards the accused&#146;s sentences, the principle of
proportionality is central to the sentencing process set out in the <I>Criminal
Code</I> and requires that a sentence must speak out against the offence but
may not exceed what is just and appropriate given the moral blameworthiness of
the offender and the gravity of the offence.&nbsp; The determination of a fit
sentence is, subject to some specific statutory rules, an individualized
process that requires the judge to weigh the objectives of sentencing in a
manner that best reflects the circumstances of the case.&nbsp; No one sentencing
objective trumps the others and the relative importance of any mitigating or aggravating
factors will push a sentence up or down the scale of appropriate sentences for
similar offences.&nbsp; The sentencing judges&#146; discretion to craft a sentence which
is tailored to the nature of the offence and the circumstances of the offender,
while broad, is not without limits.&nbsp; His discretion is limited by case law,
which sets down general ranges of sentences for particular offences which are
to be used as guidelines in order to encourage consistency between sentencing
decisions.&nbsp; It is also limited by statutes through the general sentencing
principles and objectives enshrined in the <I>Criminal Code</I> and through
legislated restrictions on the availability of certain sanctions for certain
offences.&nbsp; Sentencing judges, while they can order a sentence outside the
general range set by case law as long as it is in accordance with the
principles and objectives of sentencing, cannot override a clear statement of
legislative intent and reduce a sentence below a statutory mandated minimum,
absent a declaration that the minimum sentence is unconstitutional.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">Where the police or state misconduct relates to the
circumstances of the offence or the offender, the sentencing judge may properly
take the relevant facts into account in determining a fit and proportionate
sentence, without having to resort to s.&nbsp;24(1) of the <I>Charter</I>.&nbsp; The
circumstances of an alleged <I>Charter</I> breach which align with the
circumstances of the offence or the offender such that they are pertinent to
the sentencing regime may be relevant mitigating factors warranting a reduced
sentence.&nbsp; This is true as well for state misconduct which does not amount to a
<I>Charter </I>breach but which impacts the offender.&nbsp; As a general rule, it is
neither necessary nor useful to invoke s.&nbsp;24(1) of the <I>Charter </I>to
effect an appropriate reduction of sentence to account for any harm flowing
from unconstitutional acts of state agents consequent to the offence charged.&nbsp;
Focusing on whether impugned acts constitute <I>Charter</I> breaches and
relying on s.&nbsp;24(1) as the authority to reduce a sentence misapprehends
the flexible and contextual nature of the sentencing process.&nbsp; The sentencing
provisions of the <I>Criminal Code</I>, on their own, provide remedial
protection to individuals whose rights have been infringed.&nbsp; The broad
discretion of the sentencing judge, however, must be exercised within the
parameters of the<I> Code</I>.&nbsp; The sentence must respect statutory minimums
and other provisions which prohibit certain forms of sentence available in the
case of specific offences.&nbsp; Although in some exceptional cases a sentence
reduction outside statutory limits may be possible under s.&nbsp;24(1) of the <I>Charter</I>
as the sole effective remedy for egregious misconduct by state agents, this is
not such a case.</P>

</SPAN>This is a sentencing appeal from the Court of Appeal of Alberta
that raises important issues in respect of constitutional remedies. The
respondent, Mr. Lyle Marcellus Nasogaluak, had his sentences for the offences
of impaired driving and flight from police reduced to conditional discharges as
a remedy for the breaches of the <I>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms </I>that
he endured at the time of his arrest and detention.&nbsp; The main issue is whether
his sentences were lawfully reduced as a remedy for the excessive force used by
police. </P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt; ">[2]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
</SPAN>The parties have focussed their submissions on the question of
whether a court may grant a sentence reduction under s. 24(1) of the <I>Charter
</I>to remedy a <I>Charter </I>breach by state actors. Framing the issue in
those terms presupposes that <I>Charter </I>breaches can only be effectively
remedied in the context of a separate and distinct <I>Charter </I>application.&nbsp;
However, that is clearly not so.&nbsp; As all statutes and the common law must be <I>Charter
</I>compliant, it should come as no surprise that an effective remedy for a
proven wrong, which also happens to be a <I>Charter </I>breach, may well be
crafted within the confines of a statutory or common law regime.&nbsp; The statutory
sentencing regime under ss. 718 to 718.2 of the <I>Criminal Code</I>, R.S.C.
1985, c. C-46, is one example.</P>

</SPAN>As we shall see, the sentencing regime provides some scope for
sentencing judges to consider not only the actions of the offender, but also
those of state actors.&nbsp; Where the state misconduct in question relates to the
circumstances of the offence or the offender, the sentencing judge may properly
take the relevant facts into account in crafting a fit sentence, without having
to resort to s. 24(1) of the <I>Charter</I>.&nbsp; Indeed, state misconduct which

</SPAN>Where the state misconduct does not relate to the circumstances
of the offence or the offender, however, the accused must seek his or her
remedy in another forum.&nbsp; Any inquiry into such unrelated circumstances falls
outside the scope of the statutory sentencing regime and has no place in the
sentence hearing.&nbsp; Likewise, a reduction of sentence could hardly constitute an
&#147;appropriate&#148; remedy within the meaning of s. 24(1) of the <I>Charter </I>where
the facts underlying the breach bear no connection to the circumstances of the
offence or the offender.</P>

</SPAN>As a general rule, therefore, it is neither necessary nor useful
to invoke s.&nbsp;24(1) of the <I>Charter </I>to effect an appropriate
reduction of sentence to account for any harm flowing from unconstitutional
acts of state agents consequent to the offence charged.&nbsp; When acting within the
boundaries of the statutory sentencing regime, of course, the sentencing judge
must exercise his or her discretion within the parameters of the <I>Criminal
Code</I>. The judge must impose sentences complying with statutory minimums and
other provisions which prohibit certain forms of sentence in respect of the
offence.</P>

statutory limit itself is challenged.&nbsp; However, the remedial power of the court
under s. 24(1) is broad.&nbsp; I therefore do not foreclose the possibility that, in
some exceptional cases, a sentence reduction outside statutory limits may be
the sole effective remedy for some particularly egregious form of misconduct by
state agents in relation to the offence and the offender.&nbsp; However, this is not

</SPAN>On the facts of this case, the Court of Appeal did not err in
upholding the trial judge&#146;s finding of excessive force by police in arresting
Mr. Nasogaluak.&nbsp; The police officers&#146; excessive use of force amounted to a
violation of the respondent&#146;s right to life, liberty and security of the person
under s. 7 of the <I>Charter</I>.&nbsp; The sentencing judge committed no error of
law or principle in choosing to take this conduct into account as a factor
tending toward a reduced sentence.&nbsp; However, he erred in ordering a sentence
that fell below the statutory minimum in the <I>Code</I>.&nbsp; The Court of Appeal
correctly substituted the order of a conditional discharge on the offence of
impaired driving with the statutorily mandated minimum fine. </P>

</SPAN>In the early morning hours of May 12, 2004, the Leduc RCMP
received a tip about an intoxicated driver.&nbsp; This tip led to a high-speed
pursuit of Mr. Nasogaluak, a then 24-year-old male of Inuit and Dene descent,
by Constable Dlin.&nbsp; After attempting to evade the police cruisers and
dangerously reversing his car toward Cst. Dlin&#146;s vehicle, Mr.&nbsp;Nasogaluak
came to an abrupt stop.&nbsp; By that point, Constables Olthof and Chornomydz had
arrived on the scene.&nbsp; Mr. Nasogaluak opened the car door and swung his feet
out of the vehicle, which prompted Cst. Dlin to point his revolver and a
flashlight toward Mr. Nasogaluak, and to order him to get out of the vehicle
with his hands up.&nbsp; Mr.&nbsp;Nasogaluak did not comply and instead placed his
feet back inside the vehicle.&nbsp; Cst.&nbsp;Chornomydz, at the ready, grabbed Mr.
Nasogaluak &#151; who was clutching onto the steering wheel and door frame at the
time &#151; and punched him in the head.&nbsp; He testified that this was to prevent Mr.
Nasogaluak from driving away and striking Cst.&nbsp;Olthof, who was standing in
front of the vehicle. Mr. Nasogaluak let go of the steering wheel and reached
out to Cst. Chornomydz, who then struck him in the head with his fist a second
time, pulled him out of the car, and wrestled him onto the ground.&nbsp; </P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt; ">[11]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">
</SPAN>Cst. Chornomydz yelled at Mr. Nasogaluak to stop resisting and
gave him a third hard punch in the head.&nbsp; Mr. Nasogaluak was pinned face down
on the pavement with Cst. Chornomydz straddling his back.&nbsp; When Mr. Nasogaluak
refused to offer up his hands to be handcuffed, Cst. Dlin punched
Mr.&nbsp;Nasogaluak in the back, twice.&nbsp; These blows were strong enough to
break Mr.&nbsp;Nasogaluak&#146;s ribs, which later punctured one of his lungs.&nbsp; Cst.
Olthof was kneeling on Mr. Nasogaluak&#146;s thigh throughout this brief struggle.&nbsp; </P>

</SPAN>Eventually, Mr. Nasogaluak was taken to the police detachment.&nbsp;
Mr.&nbsp;Nasogaluak provided two breath samples that placed him well over the
legal blood alcohol limit.&nbsp; No record was made of the force used during the
arrest, of Cst. Dlin&#146;s drawing of a weapon, or of Mr. Nasogaluak&#146;s injuries.&nbsp;
The officers provided their colleagues and superiors at the station with little
to no information about the incident, and no attempts were made to ensure that
Mr. Nasogaluak received medical attention.&nbsp; Although Mr. Nasogaluak had no
obvious signs of injury and did not expressly request medical assistance, he
did tell Cst. Olthof on two occasions that he was hurt and was observed by Cst.
Dlin crying and saying: &#147;I can&#146;t breathe.&#148;&nbsp; Corporal Deweerd, the supervisor on
duty, testified that he noticed Mr. Nasogaluak leaning over and moaning as if
in pain.&nbsp; However, Mr. Nasogaluak had replied in the negative to the question
of whether he was injured.&nbsp; Even if the police cruisers and the RCMP detachment
were outfitted with video cameras, no recordings were made or produced of any
transactions involving Mr.&nbsp;Nasogaluak. Indeed, the trial judge seems to
have had serious suspicious and concerns about the absence of videotapes and
may have drawn from it some negative inferences about the nature of the police
conduct in this case.</P>

force used by police upon his arrest, their failure to properly report his
injuries, and their failure to obtain medical assistance for those injuries
breached ss. 7, 11(<I>d</I>) and 12 of the <I>Charter</I>.&nbsp; In the alternative,

</SPAN>The trial judge held that the evidence was insufficient to make
out a s. 12 breach, but found that the police actions constituted a violation
of ss. 7 and 11(<I>d</I>) of the <I>Charter</I>.&nbsp; He held that the officers&#146;
inadequate reporting concerning the use of force constituted a threat to the
respondent&#146;s life, liberty and security of the person under s. 7 and, somewhat
surprisingly, to the presumption of innocence under s.&nbsp;11(<I>d</I>).&nbsp;
According to the trial judge, the failure by police to take Mr. Nasogaluak to
the hospital was another factor to consider in deciding whether Mr.
Nasogaluak&#146;s s. 7 rights were breached, but he did not state definitively
whether his finding of a s. 7 breach was influenced by the lack of medical

and force him to the ground.&nbsp; However, in his opinion, Cst. Chornomydz&#146;s third

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">Sirrs J. also

</SPAN>As a remedy for the <I>Charter </I>breaches, Sirrs J. granted Mr.
Nasogaluak a reduced sentence.&nbsp; He noted that offences such as fleeing from
police and impaired driving would typically be punished by incarceration of 6
to 18 months, in accordance with the paramount goals of individual deterrence
and denunciation.&nbsp; However, Sirrs J. was satisfied that those principles were
met by Mr. Nasogaluak&#146;s &#147;life-altering experience&#148; with the Leduc RCMP
(judgment of November 24, 2005, at para.&nbsp;24).&nbsp; Furthermore, he considered
the breaches to be &#147;so egregious as to justify taking Mr.&nbsp;Nasogaluak from
the realm of cases that require incarceration&#148; (para. 25).&nbsp; Since sentence
reduction was an available and appropriate remedy in the circumstances of the
case, he refused Mr.&nbsp;Nasogaluak&#146;s application for a stay of proceedings,
holding that this was not one of the &#147;clearest of cases&#148; in which a stay was
necessary to remedy the prejudice to trial fairness arising from the breach (<I>R.

it held that sentence reduction was available to remedy a <I>Charter </I>breach
in two circumstances: if the breach somehow mitigated the seriousness of the
offence, or if it imposed additional punishment or hardship on the accused.&nbsp;

the <I>Criminal Code</I>.&nbsp; Instead, it entered a conviction and ordered Mr.

of the principles of law concerning sentence reduction under s. 24(1).&nbsp; In
particular, he agreed that while sentence reduction may be available in some
circumstances to remedy a <I>Charter </I>breach, a sentence cannot be reduced
below a statutory minimum.&nbsp; Accordingly, he would have substituted the minimum

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt; ">[25]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">
</SPAN>However, he took a more cautious approach to the <I>Charter </I>remedy
of sentence reduction.&nbsp; He held that Sirrs J. had erred in not considering or
applying the test for sentence reduction from <I>Glykis </I>and in failing to
provide any adequate explanation for the sentence he had ordered.&nbsp; In his
opinion, such an explanation was necessary in light of the &#147;patchy evidence and
brief and contradictory fact findings&#148; (para. 62), which did not point
conclusively to sentence reduction as the appropriate remedy. Indeed, he held
that while there was no statutory minimum penalty for the offence of evading a
police officer, the jurisprudential and sentencing guidelines for that offence
are akin to a minimum penalty below which <I>Charter </I>relief should be &#147;slow
to drop&#148; (para. 59).&nbsp; Given the trial judge&#146;s preference for the police
officers&#146; testimony over that of Mr. Nasogaluak, C&ocirc;t&eacute; J.A. had difficulty
accepting that the <I>Charter </I>breaches were so egregious that they
warranted the remedy of a conditional discharge. C&ocirc;t&eacute; J.A. refused to uphold
the trial judge&#146;s order as his reasons were simply too inadequate and

</SPAN>This appeal raises a number of questions that can be addressed by

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify">(1) Did the
Court of Appeal err in upholding the trial judge&#146;s conclusion that the police
had used excessive force to arrest Mr. Nasogaluak, and that the circumstances
of Mr. Nasogaluak&#146;s arrest and detention amounted to a violation of s. 7 of the
<I>Charter</I>? </P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify">(2) Was the
Court of Appeal wrong in deciding that sentence reduction can be a just and
appropriate remedy for an established <I>Charter </I>breach under s.&nbsp;24(1)
of the <I>Charter</I>? May breaches of fundamental rights be addressed through
the sentencing process under the <I>Criminal Code</I>?&nbsp; If the Court of Appeal
did not err, then what, if any, limitations may circumscribe a judge&#146;s
discretion to reduce a sentence as a <I>Charter </I>remedy?</P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt; ">[27]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">
</SPAN>The Crown argues that, first, the Court of Appeal applied an
incorrect standard of review to the trial judge&#146;s findings regarding excessive
force.&nbsp; It submits that the trial judge made a number of material errors of law
that should have been reviewed on the correctness standard and overturned on
appeal.&nbsp; In particular, the Crown points to Sirrs J.&#146;s failure to assess the
degree of force used by police against the legal standard articulated in ss. 25
and 27 of the <I>Criminal Code</I> and in the relevant case law.&nbsp; The Crown
argues that the Court of Appeal, having found that the trial judge made several
contradictory findings of fact and that he did not refer to the relevant legal
principles, erred in upholding Sirrs J.&#146;s conclusions on excessive force.&nbsp; </P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt; ">[28]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">
</SPAN>The Crown also challenges the Court of Appeal&#146;s conclusion
regarding the use of sentence reduction as a <I>Charter </I>remedy.&nbsp; While
conceding that sentence reduction might be appropriate when the <I>Charter </I>breach
results in an additional form of punishment for the offender, the Crown submits
that s. 24(1) should not be used to circumvent the statutory and common law
principles of sentencing.&nbsp; It argues that a sentence reduced pursuant to s.
24(1) must still fall within the range of appropriate sentences for that
offence.&nbsp; According to the Crown, the discretion to reduce a sentence below
this range would undermine the principles of proportionality and parity. It
would also impermissibly shift the focus of the sentencing process away from
the culpability of the offender and the gravity of the offence to the conduct
of state officials. </P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt; ">[29]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">
</SPAN>Finally, the Crown contests the legality and the fitness of the
particular sentence that was ordered.&nbsp; In respect of the impaired driving
conviction, it submits that the conditional discharge is an illegal sentence
because such a sentence is not available at law, as the <I>Criminal Code </I>provides
for a minimum sentence. In the case of the flight from police conviction, it
argues that, although legal, the sentence is completely inadequate and,
therefore, unfit. Nevertheless, given the particular circumstances of the case,
the Crown indicated that it would be satisfied, for the sake of principle, with
a token one-day sentence on this offence. It submits that a conditional
discharge can be ordered only in exceptional circumstances, none of which was
present in this case.&nbsp; The Crown points to the seriousness of the offences, the
deliberate nature of Mr.&nbsp;Nasogaluak&#146;s flight from police, and the public
interest in holding the respondent responsible for his actions to suggest that
the conditional discharge was &#147;wholly inappropriate&#148; and &#147;demonstrably unfit&#148;
(A.F., at para. 116).&nbsp; Even if sentence reduction had been an appropriate
remedy in these circumstances, the Crown argues that the Court of Appeal should
have intervened to increase the quantum of the sentence to, at the very least,
a period of incarceration.&nbsp; The Crown asks that the matter be sent back to the
sentencing court for reconsideration.</P>

</SPAN>The respondent Mr. Nasogaluak submits that the Court of Appeal
correctly reviewed and applied the legal principles on excessive force and asks
this Court to uphold its finding of a s. 7 <I>Charter</I> breach.&nbsp; He also asks
this Court to affirm the availability of sentence reduction as a s. 24(1) <I>Charter</I>
remedy.&nbsp; He argues that the sentencing principles in the <I>Criminal Code</I>
should not impede an individual&#146;s exercising a right to a meaningful <I>Charter</I>
remedy. He asks this Court to adopt a broad interpretation of s. 24(1) that
would allow for the reduction of sentences below the regular range of
appropriate sentences in order to remedy a <I>Charter </I>breach. </P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt; ">[31]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">
</SPAN>In a cross-appeal, Mr. Nasogaluak submits that the Court of
Appeal erred in substituting a $600 fine for the conditional discharge on the
offence of impaired driving. In his opinion, the court&#146;s broad discretion under
s. 24(1) permits it to reduce a sentence below the statutory minimum when
necessary to provide effective <I>Charter </I>relief.&nbsp; He analogizes his case
to that of <I>R. v. Wust</I>, 2000 SCC 18, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 455, in which this
Court held that a mandatory minimum sentence could be reduced to credit the
offender&#146;s time spent in pre-trial custody.&nbsp; In his opinion, the only
constraint on the court&#146;s power to order a reduced sentence is the
constitutional division of powers between the federal Parliament and the
provincial legislatures.&nbsp; Accordingly, Mr.&nbsp;Nasogaluak asks this Court to
restore the conditional discharge for the offence of impaired driving.</P>

</SPAN>The Crown emphasized the issue of excessive force in its submissions
to this Court, arguing strenuously that the police officers had not abused
their authority or inflicted unnecessary injuries on Mr. Nasogaluak.&nbsp; But
police officers do not have an unlimited power to inflict harm on a person in
the course of their duties.&nbsp; While, at times, the police may have to resort to
force in order to complete an arrest or prevent an offender from escaping
police custody, the allowable degree of force to be used remains constrained by
the principles of proportionality, necessity and reasonableness.&nbsp; Courts must
guard against the illegitimate use of power by the police against members of
our society, given its grave consequences.</P>

</SPAN>Section 25(1) essentially provides that a police officer is
justified in using force to effect a lawful arrest, provided that he or she
acted on reasonable and probable grounds and used only as much force as was
necessary in the circumstances.&nbsp; That is not the end of the matter.&nbsp; Section
25(3) also prohibits a police officer from using a greater degree of force,
i.e. that which is intended or likely to cause death or grievous bodily harm,
unless he or she believes that it is necessary to protect him- or herself, or
another person under his or her protection, from death or grievous bodily
harm.&nbsp; The officer&#146;s belief must be objectively reasonable.&nbsp; This means that
the use of force under s. 25(3) is to be judged on a subjective-objective basis
(<I>Chartier v. Greaves</I>, [2001] O.J. No. 634 (QL) (S.C.J.), at para. 59).&nbsp;
If force of that degree is used to prevent a suspect from fleeing to avoid a

described above and to the requirement that the flight could not reasonably
have been prevented in a less violent manner.</P>

</SPAN>I do not believe that the Court of Appeal erred in upholding the
trial judge&#146;s finding that the police used excessive force in arresting Mr.
Nasogaluak.&nbsp; The court correctly stated the legal principles involved in
deciding whether the force was excessive and held that the trial judge had
adhered to those principles, regardless of whether he had cited the relevant
case law and provisions of the <I>Criminal Code</I>.&nbsp; The court reached this
conclusion despite rejecting several of the trial judge&#146;s findings of fact:
specifically, that Mr. Nasogaluak was subdued by the time Cst. Chornomydz threw
his third punch and that Cst. Dlin knew when he punched Mr. Nasogaluak in the
ribs that the suspect was unarmed (paras. 25-26).&nbsp; However, the court was
persuaded that there was sufficient evidence to support the trial judge&#146;s
finding of excessive force (para. 27).&nbsp; It noted that Sirrs J. had properly
considered the fact that Mr. Nasogaluak was pinned beneath Cst.&nbsp;Chornomydz
at the time of Cst. Dlin&#146;s punches, and had taken into account Cst.&nbsp;Dlin&#146;s
own admission at the hearing that he did not think his colleague&#146;s third punch
was necessary.&nbsp; In light of these circumstances, the court held that it was not
unreasonable for the trial judge to view the amount of force used as
excessive.&nbsp; </P>

</SPAN>One should not forget the force of these blows: the trial judge
found that Cst.&nbsp;Chornomydz was a &#147;powerful man who would pack a mean
punch&#148; (judgment of October 7, 2005, at para. 24).&nbsp; Cst. Dlin&#146;s punches were
forceful enough to break two of Mr. Nasogaluak&#146;s ribs, and ultimately led to a
punctured lung.&nbsp; Even taking into account the fact that these events occured
over a very brief period of time and that the police had to make hasty
decisions to respond to the situation at hand, in my opinion, the Court of
Appeal did not err when it found that the police had used more force than was
necessary in the circumstances.</P>

</SPAN>The next question is whether the Court of Appeal correctly upheld
the trial judge&#146;s finding that the officers&#146; conduct at the time amounted to a
violation of s. 7 of the <I>Charter</I>.&nbsp; Section 7 provides: </P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent: 20.85pt">Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person and

<DIV class="Section29">

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">Although the
Crown contested the finding of excessive force, neither party made submissions
to this Court concerning the s. 7 breach, and I do not propose to engage in a
lengthy s. 7 analysis.&nbsp; I leave for another day the question of whether police
officers may have an affirmative duty to obtain medical assistance for persons
under their care. It is enough to say, for the purposes of the present appeal,
that I accept the Court of Appeal&#146;s determination that the trial judge had made
no palpable and overriding error in his findings that the police had used
excessive force at the time of Mr. Nasogaluak&#146;s arrest.&nbsp; Further, I believe
that a breach is easily made out on the facts of this case.&nbsp; The substantial
interference with Mr. Nasogaluak&#146;s physical and psychological integrity that
occurred upon his arrest and subsequent detention clearly brings this case
under the ambit of s. 7 (<I>R. v. Morgentaler</I>, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 30; <I>Rodriguez
v. British Columbia (Attorney General)</I>, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 519). The excessive
use of force by the police officers, compounded by the failure of those same
officers to alert their superiors to the extent of the injuries they inflicted
on Mr. Nasogaluak and their failure to ensure that he received medical
attention, posed a very real threat to Mr. Nasogaluak&#146;s security of the person
that was not in accordance with any principle of fundamental justice.&nbsp; On that
evidence and record, we may assume that there was a breach of s. 7 and that
there was no limit prescribed by law justifying such a breach. The conclusion
that s. 25 was breached, in that excessive, unnecessary force was used by the
police officers at the time of the arrest, confirms it. </P>

</SPAN>The central issue in this appeal concerns the possibility of
reducing an offender&#146;s sentence to take account of a violation of his or her
constitutional rights. Our Court must determine whether a s. 24(1) remedy is
necessary to address the consequences of a <I>Charter </I>breach or whether
this can be accomplished through the sentencing process. In addressing this
issue, it is necessary first to review the principles that guide the sentencing
process under Canadian law.&nbsp; The objectives and principles of sentencing were
recently codified in ss. 718 to 718.2 of the <I>Criminal Code </I>to bring greater
consistency and clarity to sentencing decisions.&nbsp; Judges are now directed in s.
718 to consider the fundamental purpose of sentencing as that of contributing,
along with crime prevention measures, to &#147;respect for the law and the
maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society&#148;. This purpose is met by the
imposition of &#147;just sanctions&#148; that reflect the usual array of sentencing
objectives, as set out in the same provision: denunciation, general and
specific deterrence, separation of offenders, rehabilitation, reparation, and a
recent addition: the promotion of a sense of responsibility in the offender and
acknowledgement of the harm caused to the victim and to the community.&nbsp; </P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt; ">[40]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">
</SPAN>The objectives of sentencing are given sharper focus in s. 718.1,
which mandates that a sentence be &#147;proportionate to the gravity of the offence
and the degree of responsibility of the offender&#148;.&nbsp; Thus, whatever weight a
judge may wish to accord to the objectives listed above, the resulting sentence
<I>must </I>respect the fundamental principle of proportionality.&nbsp; Section
718.2 provides a non-exhaustive list of secondary sentencing principles,
including the consideration of aggravating and mitigating circumstances, the
principles of parity and totality, and the instruction to consider &#147;all
available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the
circumstances&#148;, with particular attention paid to the circumstances of
aboriginal offenders.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt; ">[41]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">
</SPAN>It is clear from these provisions that the principle of
proportionality is central to the sentencing process (<I>R. v. Solowan</I>,
2008 SCC 62, [2008] 3 S.C.R. 309, at para. 12).&nbsp; This emphasis was not borne of
the 1996 amendments to the <I>Code</I> but, rather, reflects its long history
as a guiding principle in sentencing (e.g. <I>R. v. Wilmott</I> (1966), 58
D.L.R. (2d) 33 (Ont. C.A.)).&nbsp; It has a constitutional dimension, in that s. 12
of the <I>Charter</I> forbids the imposition of a grossly disproportionate
sentence that would outrage society&#146;s standards of decency.&nbsp;&nbsp; But what does

</SPAN>For one, it requires that a sentence not <I>exceed </I>what is
just and appropriate, given the moral blameworthiness of the offender and the
gravity of the offence.&nbsp; In this sense, the principle serves a limiting or
restraining function.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the rights-based, protective angle of
proportionality is counter-balanced by its alignment with the &#147;just deserts&#148;
philosophy of sentencing, which seeks to ensure that offenders are held
responsible for their actions and that the sentence properly reflects and
condemns their role in the offence and the harm they caused (<I>R. v. M. (C.A.)</I>,
[1996] 1 S.C.R. 500, at para.&nbsp;81; <I>Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act</I>, [1985]
2 S.C.R. 486, at pp. 533-34, <I>per</I> Wilson J., concurring).&nbsp; Understood in
this latter sense, sentencing is a form of judicial and social censure (J.V.
Roberts and D.P. Cole, &#147;Introduction to Sentencing and Parole&#148;, in Roberts and
Cole, eds., <I>Making Sense of Sentencing </I>(1999), 3, at p. 10). Whatever
the rationale for proportionality, however, the degree of censure required to
express society&#146;s condemnation of the offence is always limited by the
principle that an offender&#146;s sentence must be equivalent to his or her moral
culpability, and not greater than it.&nbsp; The two perspectives on proportionality
thus converge in a sentence that both speaks out against the offence and
punishes the offender no more than is necessary.</P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt; ">[43]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">
</SPAN>The language in ss. 718 to 718.2 of the <I>Code</I> is
sufficiently general to ensure that sentencing judges enjoy a broad discretion
to craft a sentence that is tailored to the nature of the offence and the
circumstances of the offender.&nbsp; The determination of a &#147;fit&#148; sentence is,
subject to some specific statutory rules, an individualized process that
requires the judge to weigh the objectives of sentencing in a manner that best
reflects the circumstances of the case (<I>R. v. Lyons</I>, [1987] 2 S.C.R.
309; <I>M. (C.A.)</I>; <I>R. v. Hamilton </I>(2004), 72 O.R. (3d) 1 (C.A.)).&nbsp;
No one sentencing objective trumps the others and it falls to the sentencing
judge to determine which objective or objectives merit the greatest weight,
given the particulars of the case.&nbsp; The relative importance of any mitigating
or aggravating factors will then push the sentence up or down the scale of
appropriate sentences for similar offences.&nbsp; The judge&#146;s discretion to decide
on the particular blend of sentencing goals and the relevant aggravating or
mitigating factors ensures that each case is decided on its facts, subject to
the overarching guidelines and principles in the <I>Code</I> and in the case
law.&nbsp; </P>

</SPAN>The wide discretion granted to sentencing judges has limits.&nbsp; It
is fettered in part by the case law that has set down, in some circumstances,
general ranges of sentences for particular offences, to encourage greater
consistency between sentencing decisions in accordance with the principle of
parity enshrined in the <I>Code</I>.&nbsp; But it must be remembered that, while
courts should pay heed to these ranges, they are guidelines rather than hard
and fast rules.&nbsp; A judge can order a sentence outside that range as long as it
is in accordance with the principles and objectives of sentencing. Thus, a
sentence falling outside the regular range of appropriate sentences is not
necessarily unfit.&nbsp; Regard must be had to all the circumstances of the offence
and the offender, and to the needs of the community in which the offence
occurred.</P>

</SPAN>The discretion of a sentencing judge is also constrained by
statute, not only through the general sentencing principles and objectives
enshrined in ss. 718 to 718.2 articulated above but also through the restricted
availability of certain sanctions in the <I>Code</I>.&nbsp; For instance, s. 732
prohibits a court from ordering that a sentence of imprisonment exceeding 90
days be served intermittently.&nbsp; Similar restrictions exist for sanctions such
as discharges (s. 730), fines (s. 734), conditional sentences (s. 742.1) and
probationary terms (s. 731).&nbsp; Parliament has also seen fit to reduce the scope
of available sanctions for certain offences through the enactment of mandatory
minimum sentences.&nbsp; A relatively new phenomenon in Canadian law, the minimum
sentence is a forceful expression of governmental policy in the area of
criminal law.&nbsp; Certain minimum sentences have been successfully challenged
under s. 12 of the <I>Charter</I> on the basis that they constituted grossly
disproportionate punishment in the circumstances of the case (<I>R.&nbsp;v.
Smith</I>, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1045; <I>R. v. Bill </I>(1998), 13 C.R. (5th) 125
(B.C.S.C.)), while others have been upheld (<I>R. v. Morrisey</I>, 2000 SCC 39,
[2000] 2 S.C.R. 90).&nbsp; Absent a declaration of unconstitutionality, minimum
sentences must be ordered where so provided in the <I>Code</I>.&nbsp; A judge&#146;s
discretion does not extend so far as to override this clear statement of
legislative intent.</P>

</SPAN>Appellate courts grant sentencing judges considerable deference
when reviewing the fitness of a sentence.&nbsp; In <I>M</I>. <I>(C.A.)</I>, Lamer
C.J. cautioned that a sentence could only be interfered with if it was
&#147;demonstrably unfit&#148; or if it reflected an error in principle, the failure to
consider a relevant factor, or the over-emphasis of a relevant factor (at
para.&nbsp;90; see also <I>R. v. L.M.</I>, 2008 SCC 31, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 163, at

McKnight </I>(1999), 135 C.C.C. (3d) 41 (Ont. C.A.), at para.&nbsp;35, however,
this does not mean that appellate courts can interfere with a sentence simply
because they would have weighed the relevant factors differently:</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify">To suggest
that a trial judge commits an error in principle because in an appellate
court&#146;s opinion the trial judge gave too much weight to one relevant factor or
not enough weight to another is to abandon deference altogether.&nbsp; The weighing
of relevant factors, the balancing process is what the exercise of discretion
is all about.&nbsp; To maintain deference to the trial judge&#146;s exercise of
discretion, the weighing or balancing of relevant factors must be assessed
against the reasonableness standard of review.&nbsp; Only if by emphasizing one
factor or by not giving enough weight to another, the trial judge exercises his
or her discretion unreasonably should an appellate court interfere with the
sentence on the ground the trial judge erred in principle.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

</SPAN>The sentencing principles described above must be understood and
applied&nbsp; within the overarching framework of our Constitution.&nbsp; Thus it may, at
times, be appropriate for a court to address a <I>Charter </I>breach when
passing sentence.&nbsp; This may&nbsp; be accomplished without resort to s. 24(1) of the <I>Charter</I>,
given the court&#146;s broad discretion under ss. 718 to 718.2 of the <I>Code </I>to
craft a fit sentence that reflects all the factual minutiae of the case.&nbsp; If
the facts alleged to constitute a <I>Charter </I>breach are related to one or
more of the relevant principles of sentencing, then the sentencing judge can
properly take those facts into account in arriving at a fit sentence.&nbsp; Section
718.2(<I>a</I>) of the <I>Code </I>provides that a court should reduce a
sentence &#147;to account for <U>any</U> relevant ... mitigating circumstances
relating to the offence or the offender&#148;.&nbsp; It would be absurd to suggest that
simply because some facts also tend to suggest a violation of the offender&#146;s <I>Charter</I>
rights, they could no longer be considered relevant mitigating factors in the
determination of a fit sentence.&nbsp;&nbsp;  </P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt; ">[48]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">
</SPAN>Indeed, the sentencing regime under Canadian law must be
implemented within, and not apart from, the framework of the <I>Charter</I>.&nbsp;
Sentencing decisions are always subject to constitutional scrutiny.&nbsp; A sentence
cannot be &#147;fit&#148; if it does not respect the fundamental values enshrined in the <I>Charter</I>.&nbsp;
Thus, incidents alleged to constitute a <I>Charter </I>violation can be
considered in sentencing, provided that they bear the necessary connection to
the sentencing exercise.&nbsp; As mitigating factors, the circumstances of the
breach would have to align with the circumstances of the offence or the
offender, as required by s. 718.2 of the <I>Code</I>.&nbsp; Naturally, the more
egregious the breach, the more attention the court will likely pay to it in
determining a fit sentence.</P>

</SPAN>This is consistent with the communicative function of sentencing.
A proportionate sentence is one that expresses, to some extent, society&#146;s
legitimate shared values and concerns.&nbsp; As Lamer C.J. stated in <I>M</I>. <I>(C.A.)</I>:
</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify">Our criminal
law is also a system of values. A sentence which expresses denunciation is
simply the means by which these values are communicated. In short, in addition
to attaching negative consequences to undesirable behaviour, judicial sentences
should also be imposed in a manner which positively instills the basic set of
communal values shared by all Canadians as expressed by the <I>Criminal Code</I>.

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">A sentence that

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify">The

that of contributing to &#147;respect for the law and the maintenance of a just,
peaceful and safe society&#148;.&nbsp; This function must be understood as providing
scope for sentencing judges to consider not only the actions of the offender,
but also those of state actors.&nbsp; Provided that the impugned conduct relates to
the individual offender and the circumstances of his or her offence, the
sentencing process includes consideration of society&#146;s collective interest in
ensuring that law enforcement agents respect the rule of law and the shared

</SPAN>The conclusion that the circumstances of alleged <I>Charter </I>breaches
can be considered during sentencing, when they are relevant to the offender and
to the offence, is consistent with much of the sentencing jurisprudence.&nbsp; In
several cases, courts have reduced a sentence to reflect the prejudice caused
to the accused by the incident giving rise to a <I>Charter </I>violation,
without invoking s. 24(1).&nbsp; For instance, in <I>R. v. Munoz</I>, 2006 ABQB 901,
69 Alta. L.R. (4th) 231, an offender&#146;s overall sentence was reduced to take
account of the breach of his s. 7 and s.&nbsp;12 rights by police guards.&nbsp;
While awaiting trial for serious offences including robbery and aggravated
assault, the accused was subject to acts of physical violence by the guards and
was forced to wear a degrading prisoner uniform called a &#147;baby doll&#148;.&nbsp; Writing
for the court, Wilkins J. described the accused&#146;s treatment at the hands of the
police as &#147;grossly disproportionate to the punishment that was appropriate&#148;
(para. 77).&nbsp; He held that a fit sentence, notwithstanding the <I>Charter </I>breaches,
would have been seven years&#146; imprisonment, on the high end of the scale for
those particular offences.&nbsp; Taking the breaches into account, and after
ordering an enhanced credit of 33 months for time served in the remand
facility, he ordered a sentence of two years less a day in jail.&nbsp; The court did
not cite s. 24(1) of the <I>Charter </I>as authority for the sentence
reduction.</P>

committing a break and enter.&nbsp; After an officer fired a shot into the air, Mr.
Pigeon returned from whence he had fled &#151; unarmed and unaggressive &#151; with the
intent to surrender.&nbsp; The officer grabbed Mr. Pigeon by the hair and threw him
onto the pavement.&nbsp; Rather than handcuff the accused at this point, the officer
lifted him back up and dragged him by the hair to where the other officer was
stationed.&nbsp; He threw him onto the ground again and, with the other officer&#146;s
foot firmly placed on the accused&#146;s neck, handcuffed him.&nbsp; Mr. Pigeon did not

</SPAN>It is important to note that a sentence can be reduced in light
of state misconduct even when the incidents complained of do not rise to the
level of a <I>Charter </I>breach.&nbsp; In <I>Pigeon</I>, the court did not need to
determine whether the accused&#146;s s. 7 rights had been violated, as there was
sufficient scope within the regular sentencing process to address the
impropriety of the police officers&#146; actions.&nbsp; Likewise, the Ontario Court of
Appeal held in <I>R. v. Bosley </I>(1992), 18 C.R. (4th) 347, that the trial
judge had properly considered excessive but not unconstitutional delay as a
mitigating factor in his determination of a fit sentence (see also <I>R. v.

delay in the proceedings as a relevant mitigating factor that led to a reduced
sentence for the offence of trafficking in cocaine.&nbsp; Although the delay did not
amount to a s. 11(<I>b</I>) violation, the court held that it had caused
prejudice to the accused that was relevant and probative to the sentencing
process.&nbsp; The majority of the Alberta Court of Appeal, in brief oral reasons
(2004 ABCA 211 (CanLII)), reversed the trial judge&#146;s decision and imposed a
sentence of incarceration of two years less a day and a heavy fine. &nbsp;The
majority did not state whether it disagreed with the trial judge&#146;s finding that
delay was a relevant mitigating circumstance, but it is notable that its final

</SPAN>To be certain, the concept of recognizing harm or prejudice
caused to the offender as a mitigating circumstance upon sentencing did not
originate with the <I>Charter</I>.&nbsp; In the pre-<I>Charter</I> case of <I>R. v.
Kirzner </I>(1976), 14 O.R. (2d) 665, the Ontario Court of Appeal reduced a
sentence for drug offences to reflect the police force&#146;s role in exposing the
offender to the opportunity to commit the offences for which he was convicted.&nbsp;
The RCMP had used the offender, who was addicted to heroin, as an informer to
infiltrate and gain information about the drug trade in Montreal.&nbsp; The court
found that, although the defence of entrapment was not available to the
accused, the police were sufficiently implicated in the offender&#146;s actions to
warrant a reduction of his sentence.&nbsp; Likewise, the Ontario Court of Appeal
reduced a sentence in the pre-<I>Charter</I> context to mitigate the effects of
an unlawful search of the accused&#146;s premises in <I>R. v. Steinberg</I>, [1967]
1 O.R. 733.&nbsp; Excessive delay attributable to the prosecution or police has also
been considered a mitigating factor in a number of pre-<I>Charter</I> cases (<I>R.

strategically delayed charges in respect of contemporaneous offences has led to
reduction of the sentences (<I>R. v. Parisien</I> (1971), 3 C.C.C. (2d) 433
(B.C.C.A.); <I>R. v. Burke</I>, [1968] 2 C.C.C. 124 (Ont. C.A.); <I>R. v. Fairn

regime.&nbsp; Of course, as we shall see, as a general rule, a court cannot reduce a
sentence below a mandatory minimum or order a reduced sentence that is not
provided for by statute.&nbsp; That said, circumstances of a <I>Charter </I>breach
or other instances of state misconduct, in exceptional circumstances, do allow
a court to derogate from the usual rules to which its decisions are subject.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">(3)&nbsp; <U>Section 24(1) of the <I>Charter</I> and the Sentencing Process</U></P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt; ">[56]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">
</SPAN>Much of the discussion in this appeal turned on the reduction of
sentences for acts that might also be<I> Charter </I>breaches.&nbsp; But this
intense debate reflects a misapprehension of the flexibility and contextual
nature of the sentencing process in Canada. It is true that a substantial
strand of jurisprudence, emanating from several provinces, has granted reductions
of sentences under s. 24(1) as <I>Charter </I>remedies, in order to impose a
just and appropriate punishment in specific cases. This jurisprudence may not
have been completely mindful that events which justify findings of <I>Charter </I>breaches
may also be circumstances which can legitimately form part of the analytical
process leading to a fit sentence under the provisions of the <I>Criminal Code</I>.&nbsp;
On their own, without the need to fall back upon the <I>Charter</I>, these
provisions can generally provide remedial protection to individuals whose
rights have been infringed. With this in mind, I will now briefly review these
cases.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt; ">[57]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">
</SPAN>In the early days of the <I>Charter</I>, La Forest J. recognized
sentence reduction as falling along the range of potential s. 24(1) remedies in
<I>Mills v. The Queen</I>, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 863, at p.&nbsp;974. Since then, the
disagreements in the jurisprudence about whether sentence reduction is <I>prima
facie</I> available as a <I>Charter </I>remedy have centred more on the types
of limits that should constrain a court&#146;s resort to this remedy than on the
availability of such a remedy.</P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt; ">[58]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">
</SPAN>In a number of cases, courts have adopted a contextual and
flexible approach to sentence reduction under s. 24(1), and have not imposed
any strict limits on its use.&nbsp; In <I>R. v. Charles</I> (1987), 61 Sask. R. 166,
the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal against the trial judge&#146;s
order of a reduced sentence for a man convicted of assaulting his wife.&nbsp; The
trial judge found that the accused&#146;s s. 9 rights were violated when he was arbitrarily
held in custody for 12 additional hours.&nbsp; As a s. 24(1) remedy, the judge
ordered a suspended sentence with a one-year probationary period.&nbsp; The Court of
Appeal concluded that a substantial reduction in the usual penalty that would
be imposed for such an offence was appropriate in the circumstances of the
case.&nbsp; Subsequent cases from Saskatchewan have reduced sentences in order to
remedy breaches of s. 9 (<I>R. v. Bear</I> (1988), 72 Sask. R. 99 (Prov. Ct.); <I>R.
v. S.L.L.</I>, 2002 SKQB 425, 229 Sask. R. 96) and s. 12 (<I>R. v. Foulds</I>,
[1998] S.J. No. 560 (QL) (Prov. Ct.)) of the <I>Charter</I>.&nbsp; </P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt; ">[59]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">
</SPAN>The New Brunswick Court of Appeal has also employed the remedy of
sentence reduction fairly liberally in a number of <I>Charter </I>cases.&nbsp; Most
notably, the court in<I> R. v. Dennison </I>(1990), 109 N.B.R. (2d) 388,
reduced a sentence for attempted murder from 12 to 9 years&#146; imprisonment
following the trial judge&#146;s failure to allow the accused to speak to his
sentence. Similarly, it halved a six-month jail sentence as a remedy for the accused&#146;s
arbitrary detention (<I>R. v. MacPherson </I>(1995), 166 N.B.R. (2d) 81), and
reduced a sentence from 12 months&#146; imprisonment to time served, to remedy the
s. 7 breach arising from counsel&#146;s dual representation of the Crown and the
accused (<I>R. v. Zwicker </I>(1995), 169 N.B.R. (2d) 350).</P>

</SPAN>Courts in other jurisdictions have followed the trend of ordering
a reduced sentence as an appropriate and just remedy for breaches of s. 7 (<I>Carlini
Bros. Body Shop Ltd. v. The Queen </I>(1992), 10 O.R. (3d) 651 (Gen. Div.)); s.

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt; ">[61]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">
</SPAN>Other courts have approached the use of sentence reduction as a <I>Charter</I>
remedy with greater hesitation.&nbsp; In <I>Glykis</I>, the Ontario Court of Appeal
held that the trial judge should not have compensated for improper police
action by reducing the offenders&#146; sentences.&nbsp; The two accused were apprehended
at Pearson airport when they admitted to smuggling drugs into the country under
their clothing.&nbsp; They were informed of their right to counsel but were denied
the right to consult with a lawyer until after they had been searched.&nbsp; As a
result, their consultation was delayed by approximately two hours.&nbsp; Writing for
the court, Dubin C.J.O. upheld the trial judge&#146;s finding of a s. 10(<I>b</I>)
breach but concluded that sentence reduction should only be afforded as a <I>Charter
</I>remedy if the breach somehow mitigates the seriousness of the offence, or
if it constitutes a form of additional punishment or hardship for the accused.&nbsp;
Despite his concerns with the trial judge&#146;s reasoning, Dubin C.J.O. upheld the
12-month concurrent sentences ordered at trial. </P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt; ">[62]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">
</SPAN>These two limits on the use of sentence reduction to remedy a <I>Charter
</I>breach from <I>Glykis</I> were&nbsp; mentioned by the B.C. Court of Appeal in <I>R.
v. Carpenter</I>, 2002 BCCA 301, 168 B.C.A.C. 137.&nbsp; In that case, the court
delivered a fairly scathing criticism of sentence reduction as a s. 24(1)
remedy.&nbsp; The accused in <I>Carpenter</I> was convicted for importing heroin
into Canada and appealed his conviction and his sentence based on the ss. 8 and
10(<I>b</I>) breaches he suffered at the time of his arrest.&nbsp; Newbury J.A., for
the majority, held that sentence reduction under s. 24(1) was problematic in
that it would offend the principles and objectives of sentencing in ss. 718 to
718.2 of the <I>Criminal Code</I>, it would impermissibly shift the focus of
the inquiry from the offender and the offence to the conduct of state
officials, and it would stretch &#147;judicial resources to their limit&#148; (para.
28).&nbsp; Her ruling essentially foreclosed the possibility of ever reducing a
sentence to remedy a <I>Charter </I>violation.&nbsp; In dissenting reasons,
Donald&nbsp;J.A.&nbsp; relied on <I>Glykis </I>and concluded that the <I>Charter </I>breaches
imposed hardship on the offender that was relevant to his punishment.&nbsp; To
&#147;credit&#148; the offender for the penalty of the breaches, Donald J.A. would have
reduced the sentence from six to five years&#146; imprisonment.</P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt; ">[63]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">
</SPAN>The judgments relying on s. 24(1) appear to have been concerned
about instances of abuse of process or misconduct by state agents in the course
of the events leading to an arrest, to charges or to other criminal
procedures.&nbsp; But, inasmuch as they relate to the offender and the offence,
those facts become relevant circumstances within the meaning of the sentencing&nbsp;
provisions of the <I>Criminal Code</I>.&nbsp; As such, they become part of the
factors that sentencing judges will take into consideration in order to
determine&nbsp; the proper punishment of the offender, without a need to turn to s.
24(1). Factors unrelated to the offence and to the offender will remain
irrelevant to the sentencing process and will have to be addressed elsewhere.
In addition, the discretion of the sentencing judge will have to be exercised
within the parameters of the <I>Criminal Code.</I> The judge must impose
sentences respecting statutory minimums and other provisions which prohibit
certain forms of sentence in the case of specific offences.</P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt; ">[64]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">
</SPAN>A few final comments about the position of the <I>Charter </I>in
relation to the sentencing process are in order.&nbsp; Like other legal processes,
the sentencing system remains subject to the scrutiny of the <I>Charter</I> and
its overarching values and principles.&nbsp; Although, as we have seen above, the
proper interpretation and application of the sentencing process will allow
courts to effectively address most of the situations where <I>Charter</I>
breaches are alleged, there may be exceptions to this general rule.&nbsp; I do not
foreclose, but do not need to address in this case, the possibility that, in
some exceptional cases, sentence reduction outside statutory limits, under s.
24(1) of the <I>Charter</I>, may be the sole effective remedy for some
particularly egregious form of misconduct by state agents in relation to the
offence and to the offender. In that case, the validity of the law would not be
at stake, the sole concern being the specific conduct of those state agents.</P>

</SPAN></I>In the present case, I agree that the acts of the police
officers are serious.&nbsp; Although the Court of Appeal did not need to rely on s.
24(1) of the <I>Charter</I>, it crafted a fit and appropriate sentence which
addressed the circumstances of the accused, while remaining within the
statutory parameters of the <I>Criminal Code.</I></P>
