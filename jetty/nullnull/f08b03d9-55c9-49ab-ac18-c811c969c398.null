<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">In an action against the Prince Edward Island Protestant
Children&#146;s Trust (&#147;Trust&#148;) and the Government of Prince Edward Island
(&#147;Province&#148;), the plaintiffs alleged physical or sexual abuse as children while
they resided in a privately owned and managed children&#146;s home (&#147;Home&#148;) between
1928 and 1976.&nbsp; Children were taken to the Home for care; some had been
orphaned while others could not be cared for by their parents.&nbsp; The Home was
closed in 1976 and its remaining assets were vested in the Trust.&nbsp; Both the
Province and the Trust deny liability.&nbsp; As a result of the action, the
Lieutenant Governor in Council brought a reference to the Prince Edward Island
Court of Appeal based upon an Agreed Statement of Facts asking the court for
its opinion about whether the Province had certain duties toward children who
had allegedly been abused while residing in the Home.&nbsp; In particular, the
reference posed 21&nbsp;questions asking whether the Province (1) owed a
general duty of care to the children; (2) had a non&#8209;delegable duty in
respect of the care given to the residents of the Home; (3) was vicariously
liable for the acts or omissions of the Board of Trustees who were entrusted to
operate the Home, or the volunteers or staff at the Home; or (4) owed a
fiduciary duty to the residents of the Home.&nbsp; The Court of Appeal advised that
the Province owed no such duties, subject to certain qualifications regarding:
children who were placed in the guardianship of the Province; and those
children who had been proposed for placement in the Home by a provincial
employee in respect of whom the court declined to give an opinion. </P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;"><I>Held</I>:&nbsp; The appeal should
be dismissed.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

</SPAN>

<DIV class="Section5">

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">The reference questions were correctly answered by the
Court of Appeal. Subject to the same qualifications stated by the Court of
Appeal, the Province owed no duties towards the children residing in the Home.&nbsp;
At all relevant times, the legislative scheme maintained two separate streams
of child welfare, one private and one public.&nbsp; In order for a privately run
children&#146;s home to have been considered part of the public stream, either the
governing body must have consented to the application of the relevant terms of
the legislation or approval must have been granted by the Lieutenant Governor
in Council.&nbsp; Given that there is no evidence in the record that the Board of
Trustees consented to the application of the relevant legislation to the Home
or that approval was either sought or given, the Province had no statutory
duties or obligations with respect to the operation, management or supervision of
the Home which would give rise to a duty of care.&nbsp; Similarly, the legislation
incorporating the Home in 1921 did not impose duties or obligations on the
Province.&nbsp; As well, the fact that the Province indirectly funded the operation
of the Home cannot support the existence of sufficient proximity between the
Province and the children to give rise to a duty of care.&nbsp; The grants were
given to the Home with no restrictions and with no accountability requirements;
their use was solely at the discretion of the Board of Trustees.&nbsp; Finally, the
power of courts to make orders in the best interests of a child under the <I>parens
patriae</I> doctrine does not support the existence of a private law duty of
care on the part of the Province towards children in the care of third parties,
and no authority was presented for the proposition that the doctrine imposes a
positive duty on the Crown to seek out and address cases of potential child
abuse.&nbsp; As found by the Court of Appeal, no duty of care in negligence arose.&nbsp;
The facts, considered in light of the applicable legislation, do not support
the existence of sufficient proximity between the Province and the residents of
the Home, pursuant to the two&#8209;stage test used to determine whether a
novel duty of care should be recognized. </P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<DIV class="Section6">

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">With respect to the claim that the Province owed a non&#8209;delegable
duty of care to the residents of the Home, the plaintiffs failed to show that
the Province was subject to a statutory duty to use care in the first place.&nbsp;
Subject to the qualification given by the Court of Appeal, the Home was not a
child welfare agency under the legislation, the children were not foster
children or wards of the Province, and the legislation created no role for the
Province in the operation of the Home, for the care of the residents, for
directing their care, or for ensuring that no harm came to them in the course
of their care by the representatives of the Home. </P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">The Court of Appeal also correctly rejected the
contention that the Province was vicariously liable for the alleged acts of
physical and sexual abuse by the Home&#146;s employees. &nbsp;Neither legislative
authority nor the placement of children by the Province directly in the Home
alone provides a foundation for the Province&#146;s vicarious liability.&nbsp; A sufficiently
close connection between the Home and the Province has not been established. </P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">Finally, the authority and duties of the Board of
Trustees with respect to the operation of the Home and the supervision of the
children left no room for a fiduciary relationship between the Province and the
children.&nbsp; Other than children who were in provincial guardianship, there were
no changes in the relationship between the Province and the residents of the
Home, either as a result of a change in factual circumstances or legislative
amendments, that would have given rise to a fiduciary relationship.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;">The limited record put forward in this case, namely a
very brief statement of facts and a compendium of legislation, impeded the
Court of Appeal in making definitive pronouncements on the issues raised in the
reference.&nbsp; The utility of the reference procedure may be called into question
where the factual basis for the reference is quite limited.</P>

the provincial government, in the period between 1928 and 1976, had certain
duties toward children who had allegedly been physically and sexually abused
while residing in a privately operated children&#146;s home.&nbsp; The court opined that,
subject to certain qualifications, there were no such duties and the appellants
now contest that conclusion (2009 PECA 1, 282 Nfld &amp; P.E.I.R. 61).&nbsp; The

of Prince Edward Island.&nbsp; This proceeding was brought against the Prince Edward
Island Protestant Children&#146;s Trust and the Government of Prince Edward Island
(the &#147;Province&#148;).&nbsp; The appellants allege that they were physically or sexually
abused as children while residing in the privately owned and managed Mount
Herbert Orphanage, the legal name for which was the Prince Edward Island
Protestant Orphanage or, from 1962, the Prince Edward Island Protestant
Children&#146;s Home (the &#147;Home&#148;).&nbsp; Children were taken to the Home for care; some
had been orphaned while others could not be cared for by their parents. The
Home was closed in 1976 and its remaining assets were vested in the Prince
Edward Island Protestant Children&#146;s Trust.&nbsp; Both the Province and the Trust
deny liability.</P>

and that the Province had neither a role in, nor any authority with respect to
its operation, management or supervision.</P>

of the Home. In brief, the Court of Appeal was asked whether the Province: owed
a general duty of care to the children placed in the Home; had any statutory
duty to supervise the operation of the Home; was vicariously liable for the
acts or omissions of the Board of Trustees, who were entrusted to operate the
Home, or the volunteers or staff at the Home; owed a fiduciary duty to the
residents of the Home; or had a non-delegable duty in respect of the care given
to the residents of the Home.&nbsp; This proceeding did not address directly the
rights of or the harm inflicted on the alleged victims, or the Province&#146;s
liability for the alleged abuse; it simply sought the opinion of the Court of
Appeal concerning the Province&#146;s duties, if any, to the children resident in
the Home at the relevant times, based on the Agreed Statement of Facts and the
legislation. The complete text of the 21 questions and the statement of agreed
facts referred to the Court of Appeal are set out in an appendix to my reasons.</P>

court: B. L. Strayer, <I>The Canadian Constitution and the Courts</I> (3rd ed.
1988), at pp. 331-32.&nbsp; Moreover, the court has discretion to give qualified
answers to, or to decline to answer, the reference questions if the record does
not permit a definitive response: <I>Reference re Same-Sex Marriage</I>, 2004

</SPAN>The very limited factual basis for the reference impedes the
Court in making definitive pronouncements about the issues raised to the point
of putting the utility of the reference process in question.&nbsp; The Court of
Appeal appropriately found that it had to limit the scope of its answers.&nbsp; It
thus added two important qualifications to its general&nbsp; conclusion that the
duties for which the appellants contend did not arise.&nbsp; The reference relates
to the situation of the plaintiffs who, as noted, were residents of the Home
between 1928 and 1976 and who were taken there primarily by their parents,
family members, guardians or charities (Agreed Fact #6).&nbsp; The Court of Appeal
found it necessary, however, to make distinctions among this group and these
distinctions led the court to add the two qualifications to which I have just
referred (paras. 85-93). </P>

</SPAN>First, 14 of the plaintiffs were placed in the guardianship of
the Province between 1956 and 1964 while still resident in the Home (Agreed
Fact #9).&nbsp; The Court of Appeal concluded that the Province owed a duty of care
to those specific children for the period of the wardship (paras. 29-31, 89-93,
and 138).&nbsp; The Province also owed these 14 children a fiduciary duty as wards
during the period of the wardship (paras. 120-22, and 142).&nbsp; Second, between
1958 and 1962, 10 of the 14 plaintiffs just described were proposed for
placement in the Home by a provincial employee, before they were accepted as
residents (Agreed Fact #8).&nbsp; The Court of Appeal ultimately declined to give an
opinion concerning a duty to these children.&nbsp; It reasoned the potential
liability of the Province in connection with negligent placement of children
was not before the court, as the reference questions and the Agreed Statement
of Facts focussed on the duties of the Province to children as residents of the
Home, rather than because of their placement by the Province in the Home
(paras. 33, 85 and 137).</P>

conclusion, the child welfare legislation in force at the time, along with
other factors, support the existence of various duties or liabilities owed to
them by the Province. Their position may best be considered by answering four

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:78.45pt;text-align:justify;text-indent: -20.85pt;">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Did the Province owe a duty of care by virtue

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:78.45pt;text-align:justify;text-indent: -20.85pt;">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Did the Province owe a fiduciary duty to the

</SPAN>As the Court of Appeal correctly noted, the appellants must
establish either the duty of care for which they contend has been settled by
existing authority, or that their case meets a two-stage test which is used to
determine if a new duty of care should be recognized. Although the appellants
maintain that their situation is analogous to cases in which a duty of care has
been found, they do not contend, nor in my view could they,&nbsp; that their case is
sufficiently similar to other decided cases so that it could be said that the
existence of a duty of care to them is settled by authority. Thus, I agree with
the Court of Appeal that their claim is based on a novel duty of care and must
be assessed according to the two-stage test used to determine whether such duties
should be recognized.</P>

</SPAN>That two-stage test&nbsp; was first enunciated in <I>Anns v. Merton
London Borough Council</I>, [1978] A.C. 728 (H.L.), and later accepted and
endorsed by this Court in <I>Kamloops (City of ) v. Nielsen</I>, [1984] 2
S.C.R. 2.&nbsp; Since then, the <I>Anns/Kamloops</I> test has been applied by the
Court in many cases including <I>Cooper v. Hobart</I>, 2001 SCC 79, [2001] 3
S.C.R. 537, <I>Edwards v. Law Society of Upper Canada</I>, 2001 SCC 80, [2001]

appropriate one even though the appellants mainly rely on statutory duties.&nbsp;
Such duties do not generally, in and of themselves, give rise to private law
duties of care.&nbsp; The <I>Anns/Kamloops</I> test determines whether public as
well as private actors owe a private law duty of care to individuals enabling
them to sue the public actors in a civil suit: see, e.g., <I>Ingles v. Tutkaluk
Construction Ltd.</I>, 2000 SCC 12, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 298, at para. 16; <I>Ryan

</SPAN>The first step under the <I>Anns/Kamloops</I> test is to ask
whether the relationship between the appellants and the respondents discloses
sufficient foreseeability and proximity to establish a <I>prima facie</I> duty
of care.&nbsp; If it does, the analysis moves to the second step which is concerned
with whether there are residual policy considerations, transcending the
relationship between the parties, that negate the existence of such a duty.</P>

</SPAN>The appellants submit that the Province had a duty of care to the
children in the Home because its relationship to them was a type of
paternalistic relationship of supervision and control analogous to that between
a parent and child.&nbsp; They separate their submissions into distinct arguments
about a duty of care arising at common law, by statute or by virtue of the <I>parens
patriae</I> doctrine. However, in my view, all of these submissions must be
considered in relation to the critical question of whether there was sufficient
foreseeability of harm and sufficient proximity between the Province and the
children living in the Home to give rise to a <I>prima facie</I> duty of care.&nbsp;
Although the Court of Appeal found that the harm was not foreseeable, in my
view the limited facts before the Court make it difficult to come to a decision
about the issue of foreseeability.&nbsp; For example, we have no facts about what
the Province knew or might reasonably be taken to have known at the time the
alleged harm occurred.&nbsp; Accordingly, in my view, it is better to focus the
analysis on whether there was sufficient proximity between the Province and the
children in the Home.</P>

</SPAN>The question of whether there is sufficient proximity is
concerned with whether the relationship between the plaintiff and defendant is
sufficiently close and direct to give rise to a legal duty of care, considering
such factors as physical closeness, expectations, representations, reliance and
the property or other interests involved: <I>Hill v. Hamilton-Wentworth

</SPAN>While the appellants rely heavily on the relevant statutory
provisions, they also point to a number of other considerations which they say
establish the necessary proximity between them and the Province.&nbsp; These factors
include that the Province provided funding to the Home; that there was a <I>parens
patriae</I> duty owed by the Province to the children in the Home; and that
there were children in the Home whom the Province had proposed for placement
there or for whom it had guardianship while they were residing there. Citing <I>Carmarthenshire
County Council v. Lewis</I>, [1955] 1 All E.R. 565 (H.L.),&nbsp; and <I>Ellis v.
Home Office</I>, [1953] 2 All E.R. 149 (C.A.), they say that their relationship
to the Province is similar to the relationship between teachers and students,
or prison officials and prisoners, both categories of cases in which a duty of
care has been recognized.&nbsp; The parties place no reliance on any possible
distinction between nonfeasance and misfeasance in their submissions on
proximity.</P>

</SPAN>Before moving on to the relevant legislation, I note that in the
Court of Appeal, the appellants relied on the fact of the regular presence in
the Home of Dr. Beck, a psychiatrist in the employ of the provincial Department
of Health, between 1964 and 1967.&nbsp; According to the Agreed Statement of Facts,
Dr. Beck became involved with the Home on his own initiative as a volunteer and
reported to the Board of Trustees, not the Province.&nbsp; Although he is said to
have authored a report which he provided to the Board,&nbsp; containing
recommendations regarding the future role and operation of the Home, there is
no further information in the record about its contents (Agreed Fact #5).&nbsp; The
Court of Appeal concluded that, on these facts, Dr. Beck&#146;s involvement did not
materially contribute to the appellants&#146; attempt to establish proximity between
the Province and the residents of the Home.&nbsp; In this Court, the appellants have
not pursued any arguments relying on the facts relating to Dr. Beck.&nbsp; I will
therefore say nothing further about them other than that I see no reason to
doubt the correctness of the Court of Appeal&#146;s approach to this issue.</P>

</SPAN>Whether sufficient proximity exists here turns mainly on the role
of the Province in relation to the Home.&nbsp; This, in turn, is primarily a
question of statutory interpretation although, as mentioned, the appellants
rely on other factors as well in support of the existence of a duty of care on
the part of the Province.&nbsp; The relevant legislation consists of the child
welfare laws of the Province during the period and the statutes relating to the
incorporation and operation of the Home.&nbsp; I will deal with these two types of

</SPAN>During the period in issue, Prince Edward Island&#146;s child welfare
legislation effectively created a two-stream system of child welfare. One
stream was essentially a private one.&nbsp; This private stream consisted of
orphanages and children&#146;s homes, like the one in issue here, which were
operated by benevolent organizations.&nbsp; While some of these organizations
received funding from the Province, on the face of the legislation they
operated independently. As we shall see, contrary to the position advanced by
the appellants and Ms. Marshall, who had intervener status before the Court of
Appeal and made written submission in this Court, the legislation enacted by
the Province during this period did not create any general duty of care towards
children residing in the Home.&nbsp; The other stream was a public one, consisting
of Children&#146;s Aid Societies (or Child Welfare Agencies, as they were later
called) which were approved by the Province under statute and were subject to
statutory standards and obligations in relation to child welfare. </P>

</SPAN>Until 1961, the statutes do not support the appellants&#146;
contention that the Province had any role in the operation, management or
supervision of the Home. A more difficult question is whether this changed with
the significant amendments made in 1961.&nbsp; However, for reasons I will set out
below, my view is that these amendments did not fundamentally change the
structure of the provincial child welfare scheme.&nbsp; It continued to consist of
two streams, a public one and a private one, with the Home being part of the
latter.</P>

legislation enacted in 1910 and in 1940. Both of these Acts were amended on a

</SPAN>The time period covered by the reference begins in 1928. At that
time, the child welfare legislation in effect was <I>The Children&#146;s Protection
Act of Prince Edward Island</I>, S.P.E.I. 1910, c. 15 (the &#147;1910 Act&#148;).&nbsp; It
provided for the appointment by the Lieutenant Governor in Council of the
Superintendent of Neglected and Dependent Children, who was responsible for
assisting in the establishment of Children&#146;s Aid Societies (organizations whose
object was the care and protection of children), and in visiting institutions
where children were placed pursuant to the legislation. The 1910 Act provided
for the creation and supervision of temporary homes or shelters for neglected
children, and made provisions for the apprehension of neglected children, the
selection of foster homes (by Children&#146;s Aid Societies), the surrender of
children by parents, and wardship. </P>

</SPAN>Contrary to the appellants&#146; submissions, the 1910 Act did not
impose obligations on the Superintendent in respect of privately run
institutions such as the Home.&nbsp; While the appellants are correct to point out
that the Superintendent had statutory obligations in relation to establishing
and advising Children&#146;s Aid Societies (s. 3), there is no evidence that the
Home was a Children&#146;s Aid Society.&nbsp; Put another way, the Home was a privately
run orphan or children&#146;s home, not a provincially approved child welfare
provider (i.e. a society approved by the Lieutenant Governor in Council for the
purposes of the 1910 Act,&nbsp; s. 2(b)).&nbsp; Similarly, while the Superintendent had a
statutory duty to direct and supervise the visiting of a place where a
neglected or dependent child had been placed, this statutory duty only applied
to children placed <I>pursuant to the provisions of the Act</I> (s. 3(d)).&nbsp;
This included places in the public stream: temporary homes and shelters
provided for under the Act by the municipal government (s. 5(1)), Children&#146;s
Aid Societies, and foster homes.&nbsp; It did not include institutions such as the
Home which were operated by third parties.&nbsp; The 1910 Act applied to such
institutions only when the governing body agreed to become part of the public
stream.&nbsp; There is no evidence that the Home did so.&nbsp; So, for example, an orphan
or children&#146;s home could be used as a temporary home or shelter under the Act,
but only with the consent of the governing body of the orphan or children&#146;s
home (s. 5(2)).&nbsp; The consent of the governing body of an orphan or children&#146;s
home (operating as a temporary home or shelter under the 1910 Act) was further
required for a Children&#146;s Aid Society to supervise and manage the children
there (s. 5(3)).&nbsp; However, as noted, there is nothing in the record to show
that the Home ever did so. </P>

</SPAN>The appellants contend that the 1910 Act conferred on the
Superintendent a right of inspection and that this provision in effect created
a duty to inspect the Home (s. 13).&nbsp; However, as pointed out earlier in the
discussion of s. 3(d), this right of inspection only applied to places where a
child was committed for care <I>under the provisions of the Act</I>.&nbsp; There is

</SPAN>In short, the legislative scheme maintained two separate streams
of child welfare, one private and one public. The Province only had roles and
duties in relation to an institution in the private stream, such as the Home,
if its governing body consented to the involvement of the Province.&nbsp; I conclude,
as did the Court of Appeal, that on the record before the Court, the 1910 Act
did not impose on the Province any statutory duties in relation to children
residing in the Home. The statute thus does not support the existence of any
proximity between those children and the Province by virtue of their residence
in the Home at that time.</P>

</SPAN>The 1940 Act, entitled <I>The Children's Act</I>, S.P.E.I. 1940,
c. 12, repealed and replaced the 1910 Act, as well as the previous legislation
dealing with financial support for deserted wives and children (<I>The Deserted
Wives' and Children's Maintenance Act</I>, S.P.E.I. 1932, c. 7).&nbsp; The 1940 Act,
Part II, maintained the distinction between privately and publicly streamed
institutions and the corresponding role of the provincial government (through
the Superintendent, or as the office was later called, the Director of Child
Welfare) as it existed in the 1910 Act.&nbsp; Nothing in the 1940 Act imposed any
new duties on the Superintendent in respect of privately run orphan or
children&#146;s homes such as the Home. As in the earlier legislation, the
Superintendent&#146;s right of inspection of places where children were being cared
for was only engaged when such children were placed there under the terms of
the Act (s. 15). The 1940 Act also maintained the public/private streams that
existed in the 1910 Act through the inclusion of provisions that required the
consent of the governing body of private institutions, before the duties of the
Superintendent would be engaged in relation to children in private care.&nbsp; Once
again, an orphan or children&#146;s home could be used as a temporary home or
shelter for neglected children, but only when the governing body of the orphan
or children&#146;s home consented to such an arrangement (ss. 7(2) and 7(3)). </P>

</SPAN>I agree with the Court of Appeal that the 1940 Act &#147;did not
create any role for the Superintendent in the management, operation, or
supervision of privately operated children&#146;s homes or orphanages&#148; (para. 15).
Throughout the time when the 1910 and 1940 Acts were in force, there were in
effect two streams of child welfare in the Province.&nbsp; Given that the Home was
operated by a private organization (and not a publicly regulated one), and
there is no evidence in the record that the Trustees consented to the
application of the relevant terms of the Act to the Home, the Superintendent
had no statutory duties or obligations with respect to the operation,
management or supervision of the Home.</P>

</SPAN>The continuing relevance of what I have referred to as the
private stream of child welfare is particularly clear in Part VI of the 1940
Act, headed &#147;Adoption by Deed&#148;.&nbsp; Binding transfers of guardianship were
contemplated to be made by agreements in writing.&nbsp; There is specific provision
in s. 107 for the assignment of guardianship of orphans and others to
charitable institutions, refuges or homes, and that when this was done, the
committee or managers of such institutions were deemed to be the legal
guardians of the children. The significant point is that this process called
for no involvement on the part of the courts, Children&#146;s Aid Societies or the
Superintendent.</P>

extend . . . the role of the Director of Child Welfare to affect or be involved
in the operations of an orphanage or children&#146;s home operated by a board of trustees&#148;
(para. 18).&nbsp; In the absence of submissions to the contrary, I see no reason to

</SPAN>The appellants contend that the 1961 Act imposed a duty on the
Director to inspect the Home. They go on to argue that this duty of inspection
supports a finding of sufficient proximity between the Province and the
children resident in the Home. However, my view is that the two premises of
this submission are faulty.&nbsp; On a correct reading of the 1961 Act, it did not
extend the scope of the Director&#146;s duties in relation to privately run
institutions such as the Home and even if it did, the bare duty to inspect is
not a sufficient basis for a finding of proximity.&nbsp; As the Court of Appeal
observed, the 1961 Act did not give the Director either responsibility or
authority in relation to the operations of privately run institutions such as
the Home.&nbsp; The 1961 Act was substantially amended in 1972.&nbsp; The appellants
placed the 1972 amendments before the Court, but made no submissions with
respect to them. I see no reason, therefore, to doubt the conclusion of the
Court of Appeal that the 1972 amendments do not affect the matters in issue.</P>

</SPAN>As previously mentioned, the appellants submit that the 1961 Act
imposed a duty on the Director to inspect the Home. The respondents disagree.&nbsp;
The key provision is s. 3(2)(c), which sets out that the Director shall</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify">inspect or

</SPAN>The appellants read this provision as applying to the Home, since
it was an &#147;institution established for the care and protection of children&#148;. &nbsp;The
respondents, however, read it as excluding the Home, since it was not an
&#147;institution established for the care and protection of children . . . <U>pursuant
to the provisions of this Act</U>&#148;.&nbsp; What separates the parties is the question
of whether the limiting language at the end of s. 3(2)(c) &#151;&nbsp; &#147;pursuant to the
provisions of this Act&#148;&#151;&nbsp; applies to <I>both</I> an institution established for

</SPAN>The text of the paragraph, read in isolation, supports both
interpretations. In addition, the definition of &#147;place of safety&#148; in s. 1(n)
refers to &#147;an institution established for the care and protection of children&#148;
without the qualifying words found in s. 3(2)(c).&nbsp; However, it is not
sufficient to read the paragraph in isolation. Rather, it must be read in its
entire context, in its grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the
scheme of the Act, the object of the Act and the intention of the Legislature: <I>Rizzo
&amp; Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re)</I>, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, at para. 21; <I>Bell
ExpressVu Limited Partnership v. Rex</I>, 2002 SCC 42, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 559, at
para. 26.&nbsp; Taking that approach, I agree that the respondents&#146; reading of the
provision is the correct one.&nbsp; The 1961 Act does not evidence any legislative
intention to dismantle or significantly change the two-stream approach to child
welfare &#151;&nbsp; with a private and public component &#151;&nbsp; that had been in place before
its enactment.&nbsp; If the appellants&#146; reading of the provision were accepted, it
would lead to a significant departure from this basic structure of the child
welfare system, and the Act as a whole does not support any legislative
intention to do so.</P>

</SPAN>The duties of the Director of Child Welfare are set out in s.
3(2) of the 1961 Act.&nbsp; As with the previous Acts, the Director had a statutory
duty to assist in the establishment and continued advising of Child Welfare
Agencies, which were again defined as organizations approved by the Lieutenant
Governor in Council (s. 1(d)), and were thus public or quasi-public in nature.&nbsp;
The 1961 Act also sets out the parameters under which a child welfare agency
could be established (ss. 4 to 7).&nbsp; While the Lieutenant Governor in Council
had the authority to grant or revoke an order approving a Child Welfare Agency,
he had no such authority in relation to privately run institutions which
provided care for neglected children.&nbsp; As in previous versions of the Act, the
Director had duties toward children committed to his care.&nbsp; Those duties
applied to a child who was a ward of the state, for whom the Director was
guardian (ss. 14 and 15), or who the Director placed in a foster home (s. 25).&nbsp;
Nothing in the 1961 Act provided that privately run institutions which were
previously outside the scope of the Director&#146;s authority were now being
included within that scope. </P>

Governor in Council pursuant to statutory authority.&nbsp; This inference arises,
say the appellants, from the fact that the Province was providing funding and,
from 1958, placing children in the Home. I cannot agree.&nbsp; The Home could only
have been a Children&#146;s Aid Society or agency if approval had been granted by
the Lieutenant Governor in Council.&nbsp; There is nothing in the record provided on

Legislature: <I>An Act to Incorporate the Prince Edward Island Protestant
Orphanage</I>, S.P.E.I. 1921, c. 27. As the Court of Appeal pointed out, the
Act was amended on a number of occasions over the years (paras. 21-25). This
legislation did not impose duties or obligations on the Province.&nbsp; As the Court
of Appeal aptly observed, &#147;There was no provision for any Government
involvement in the business or property of the Orphanage&#148; (para. 22).&nbsp; The Act
provided for the establishment of a Board of Trustees, the appointment of
Trustees and an executive committee, and set out that the active management of
the Home would be the responsibility of the executive.&nbsp; The executive was also
responsible for employing, hiring and firing agents and servants for the Home.
Amendments to the Act from 1921 to 1977 did not alter the fact that the Home
was privately managed and run, distinct from public facilities for neglected
children.&nbsp; In short, this legislation does not at all assist the appellants in
establishing proximity between the Province and themselves as residents of the
Home.</P>

</SPAN>The appellants also rely on the financial relationship between
the Home and the Province as a basis for finding proximity.&nbsp; The Province
indirectly funded the operation of the Home in the form of grants between 1928
and 1976.&nbsp; Between 1928 and 1967, these grants represented anywhere between 8
and 18 percent of the operating receipts of the Home in a given year.&nbsp; These
amounts increased to between 16 and 31 percent after 1968 as a result of
arrangements between the Province and the federal government under the Canada
Assistance Plan (Agreed Facts #11-12).&nbsp; However, the important point for the
purpose of this appeal is that these grants were given to the Home with no
restrictions and no accountability requirements; their use was solely at the
discretion of the Board of Trustees (Agreed Fact #13).&nbsp; With respect, such a
financial arrangement cannot support the existence of sufficient proximity
between the Province and the children.</P>

</SPAN>The appellants argue that the duty of care to all residents of
the Home was expanded after 1958 when the Province began to place children
directly in the Home, since, they contend, the supervision of one child
essentially meant the supervision of all.&nbsp; This submission relates to the
qualifications articulated by the Court of Appeal.&nbsp; The Court of Appeal chose
not to address the duty of care issue in relation to the proposal by provincial
employees that certain children be placed in the Home.&nbsp; The court reasoned that
a potential duty in relation to allegedly negligent placement decisions was not
properly before the court on the reference (para. 137).&nbsp; The Court of Appeal
also was clear that duties did arise in relation to children who were resident
in the Home when they became wards of the Province; the Province owed a duty of
care as guardian to those children for the period of the wardship (para. 138).&nbsp;
As I understand it, the appellants argue that sufficient proximity between the
Province and all children residing in the Home has been established because
there were certain children in the Home whom the Province had proposed for
placement there, or over whom it had guardianship while they were residing
there.&nbsp; In other words, they contend that if the Province had a duty of care to
one child resident in the Home there would be a duty to all who were resident
at the same time, as it would be artificial to suggest that the Province could
have a duty of care to one child but not to the child in the next bed or the
next room.</P>

</SPAN>Respectfully, this does not necessarily follow for two reasons.&nbsp;
First, the fact of legal guardianship matters in considering whether a duty of
care exists.&nbsp; Parents, for example, owe duties to their own children but not
necessarily to other children who may be near them.&nbsp; Second, even if, for the
sake of the argument, one were to accept the appellants&#146; point that a duty to
one would give rise to a duty to all, the limited factual record here would not
support the application of that principle to the other appellants.&nbsp; There is
nothing in the record to show that any of the other appellants resided in the
Home at the time that the 14 appellants who were in the guardianship of the
Province were residing there. Similarly, the record is lacking with respect to
10 of the 14 children just mentioned who were initially proposed for placement
in the Home by the Province.&nbsp; There is nothing in the record to show whether
their placement occurred at the time any of the other appellants, who were not
wards of the Province, resided there.&nbsp; In my view, the Court of Appeal made no
error in refusing to find a duty of care on this record.</P>

</SPAN>The appellants briefly submitted in their factum that the Province
had a duty to them arising from the doctrine of <I>parens patriae</I>.&nbsp; Whether
there exists a free-standing duty of <I>parens patriae</I>, owed by the
Province to all vulnerable children, is not a question presented by this
reference.&nbsp; Rather, the relevant reference questions focus on whether the
Province owed a duty of care to the appellants, by virtue of their being
residents in the Home.&nbsp; I therefore agree with the Court of Appeal&#146;s approach
which was to consider the appellants&#146; <I>parens patriae</I> submissions as part
of their attempt to show sufficient proximity apart from the statutory
framework.</P>

</SPAN>The <I>parens patriae</I> doctrine means different things in
different contexts. Historically, it referred to a broad and virtually
undefined authority of the Crown over the property and person of children and
the mentally incompetent. These powers of the Crown came to be exercised by the
courts so that it is now recognized that the superior courts have certain
powers to step into the shoes of the parent and make orders in the best
interests of the child: <I>E. (Mrs.) v.&nbsp; Eve</I>, [1986] 2 S.C.R. 388.&nbsp; It has
also sometimes been said that the Attorney General&#146;s standing to act in the
public interest, such as in pursuing civil claims in public nuisance, is
attributable to the Crown&#146;s role as <I>parens patriae</I>: <I>British Columbia
v. Canadian Forest Products Ltd.</I>, 2004 SCC 38, [2004] 2 S.C.R. 74, at para.
67.&nbsp; Although it is unclear from the appellants&#146; brief submissions, it seems
that they rely on the doctrine in the former sense, that is on the power of
courts to make orders in the best interests of a child. </P>

conceived of as a protective jurisdiction which confers the power to act.&nbsp; It
is commonly exercised by a superior court on a case&#8209;by-case basis as a
matter of judicial discretion; it is not generally thought of as a power of the
executive branch of government.&nbsp; While it is sometimes spoken of as a duty on
the part of the Crown (as, for example, in <I>King v. Low</I>, [1985] 1 S.C.R.
87, at p. 94, and <I>Re B.C. Family Relations Act</I>, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 62, at

considered in light of the applicable legislation, do not, excepting the

</SPAN>As Professor Klar states in his text <I>Tort Law </I>(4th ed.
2008),<I> </I>at p. 663, &#147;the essential feature of a non-delegable duty is that
responsibility for its execution always rests on the person upon whom the duty
is imposed.&nbsp; Although it may be delegated to another, the breach, no matter how
committed, by the delegatee, will be treated as a breach by the delegator.&#148;&nbsp;
See also <I>K.L.B. v. British Columbia</I>, 2003 SCC 51, [2003] 2 S.C.R. 403,
at paras. 30-32.&nbsp; A non-delegable duty may have its source in statute, as the
appellants here allege.&nbsp; For example, in <I>Lewis (Guardian ad litem of) v.
British Columbia</I>, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 1145, the Court found that the relevant
legislation imposed a non-delegable duty on the Ministry of Transportation and
Highways to ensure that maintenance work on the highways was performed with
reasonable care.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm; ">[55]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
</SPAN>The appellants make two principal submissions, but in my view
neither can succeed. These arguments are simply restatements in a different
form of the submissions already considered in my review of the legislation.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm; ">[56]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
</SPAN>&nbsp;First, the appellants submit that from 1910 to 1961, the
legislation described above imposed a non-delegable duty on the Superintendent
to instruct Children&#146;s Aid Societies as to the manner in which their duties
were to be performed, which included advising the Societies of their statutory
obligation to provide places of temporary refuge for a period not exceeding
three months (1910 Act, ss. 3 and 5).&nbsp; The Superintendent, the appellants
submit, breached this duty by permitting children to be kept in the Home for a
period exceeding three months.&nbsp; The short answer to this submission, however,
is the one given by the Court of Appeal (and subject to the same
qualification): the Home was not a Children&#146;s Aid Society, the children were
not foster children or wards of the Province, and the legislation created no
role for the Province in the operation of the Home or for the care of the
residents (para. 128).</P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</P>

</SPAN>The appellants also submit that another non-delegable duty arose
under s. 3 of the 1961 Act mandating the Director to inspect or direct and
supervise the inspection of the Home.&nbsp; However, this submission fails for the
reasons set out earlier.&nbsp; The Court of Appeal noted that, properly interpreted,
the relevant statutory provisions do not make the Province responsible for the
care of the residents, for directing their care, or for ensuring that no harm
came to them in the course of their care by the representatives of the Home
(para. 126). </P>

</SPAN>In short, while the appellants argue that if the Province was
under a duty to use care then it could not divest itself of that responsibility
by delegating its performance to the Home&#146;s Board of Trustees, the appellants
have failed to show that the Province was subject to a duty to use care in the
first place.</P>

duties, although this issue was not properly before the court on the reference

</SPAN>&nbsp;In addition to their submissions concerning the Province&#146;s
direct liability, the appellants advance submissions that the Province is
vicariously liable for the alleged acts of physical and sexual abuse that
occurred in the Home between 1928 and 1976. Vicarious liability is based not on
any personal wrongdoing by the party held responsible, but on the tortious
conduct of someone else: Klar, at p. 645. Vicarious liability is generally
appropriate where there is a significant connection between the party who
creates or contributes to a risk and the wrong that flows from it: <I>Bazley v.
Curry</I>, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 534, at para. 41.<I>&nbsp; </I>The person or organization
creating the risk should bear the loss: <I>Bazley</I>, at para. 31.</P>

</SPAN>The appellants&#146; submissions here largely recycle their position
with respect to a duty of care in negligence.&nbsp; They submit that the Province
exercised sufficient control over the Home through legislative authority and
statutory duties to establish the requisite connection.&nbsp; The Court of Appeal
was correct to reject these contentions.</P>

</SPAN>Legislative authority is of course not enough to impose vicarious
liability.&nbsp; If it were, a province would be vicariously liable for every act
committed in a field within its legislative authority.&nbsp; Such a proposition
cannot withstand serious scrutiny. As for the appellants&#146; submissions regarding
the Province&#146;s statutory duties in relation to the children residing in the
Home, they must be rejected for the reasons set out earlier.&nbsp; In short, there
were no such duties.</P>

</SPAN>The appellants also submit that the control by the Province over
the Home&#146;s employees was strengthened after 1958 when the Province began
placing children directly in the Home. This, however, does not provide a
foundation for the Province&#146;s vicarious liability.&nbsp; Placing children in the
Home did not confer on the Province any control over the Home&#146;s employees.&nbsp; As
the Court of Appeal put it, in my view correctly, at para. 106:&nbsp; </P>

It was not an employer.&nbsp; It had no involvement in or control over the

Facts state that the Province did not employ any person engaged by the
Orphanage to care for the residents.&nbsp; There is no basis to infer even an independent
contractor relationship between the Province and any such person engaged by the
Orphanage.&nbsp; There are no contact factors upon which a relationship could be
founded between the Province and staff of the Orphanage upon which to base

</SPAN>The appellants rely on <I>Bazley</I> and <I>K.L.B.</I>, but in my
view those authorities are not on point.&nbsp; In <I>Bazley</I>, the Court
determined that a not-for-profit organization should be held vicariously liable
for the wrongful acts of one of its employees who was found to be a pedophile,
since the care facility in which the abuse occurred was operated by the
organization and was also responsible for employing and authorizing its
employees to do everything a parent would do. The provincial government had no
such role in relation to the employees of the Home.&nbsp; In <I>K.L.B.</I>, the
relationship between foster parent tortfeasors and the provincial government
was found not to be sufficiently close to impose liability, given the
independence of foster parents from the Province in providing family care.&nbsp; In
discussing <I>K.L.B.</I>, the Court of Appeal observed that even the
relationship in issue there was &#147;much closer in terms of relevant contacts than
the minimal relationship between the Government and the Orphanage in the
present case&#148; (para. 107). To succeed in establishing vicarious liability, the
appellants have to show a close connection between the Home and the Province.&nbsp;
The appellants have failed to show such a connection.</P>

</SPAN>Subject to the qualification discussed above in relation to wards

or by virtue of them being residents of the children&#146;s home (paras. 111 and
119). The appellants say that the Court of Appeal erred in this respect.&nbsp; The
appellants emphasize the vulnerability of children in the care of others, and
liken the circumstances of this case to those in which a fiduciary duty was
found or assumed to be owed to children by parties with power over them in
particular circumstances: <I>K.L.B.</I>; <I>M. (K.) v. M. (H.)</I>, [1992] 3

</SPAN>I agree with the Court of Appeal that the authority and duties of
the Board of Trustees with respect to the operation of the Home and the
supervision of the children &#147;left no room for a fiduciary relationship between
the Government and the children who were residents there&#148; (para. 114).&nbsp; Even
taking into account the financial support of the Province, there is no
evidentiary basis to support an inference that the Province directed or had the
authority to direct the operation of the Home (para. 116). The cases relied on
by the appellants are distinguishable on their facts.&nbsp; In <I>M. (K.)</I>, the
fiduciary duty recognized by the Court was one owed by parents to children in
their care. In <I>K.L.B.</I>, the fiduciary relationship between the provincial
government and the children arose in the context of foster care: the
Superintendent of Child Welfare was the legal guardian of the children. In <I>Blackwater</I>,
where the Court assumed but did not decide there was a fiduciary duty, the
federal government had a central role in running the residential school in
which the abuse had taken place, and the children were taken from their
families and placed there pursuant to a federal statute, the <I>Indian Act</I>,
S.C. 1951, c. 29.&nbsp; There are no similar indicia of a fiduciary duty in this
case.</P>

</SPAN>Finally, I agree with the Court of Appeal that there were no
changes in the relationship between the Province and the residents of the Home
between 1928 and 1976, either as a result of a change in factual circumstances
or legislative amendments, that would have given rise to a fiduciary
relationship (para. 119).&nbsp; This conclusion is subject to the qualification set

closed in 1976. The Board of Trustees was responsible for the day to day
operations of the Home, including the hiring of staff, volunteers, daily care
of the residents and setting policies as to the admission of residents, as well
as the overall management and administration of the Home.</P>

of the Home, was not involved in the day to day operations of the Home, and did
not employ any person engaged by the Home to care for the residents. Dr. M. M.
(Mac) Beck, a psychiatrist then an employee of the P.E.I. Department of Health,
at his own initiative volunteered to be a consultant to the Board. The Board
accepted this offer and Dr. Beck attended regularly at the Home from 1964&#8209;67
and met with the children. Thereafter, he wrote an extensive Report for the
Board containing a number of recommendations regarding the future role and
operation of the Home.</P>

not be cared for by their parents, family members, guardians or charities. Some

contributions from the people of Prince Edward Island. Occasional grants were
made by municipal, provincial, federal and international groups and charities
to assist with capital and other needs. Schedule &#147;C&#148; is a summary of the annual
operating receipts and expenditures from 1928&#8209;1976 as taken from the
Annual Reports for the subject years.</P>

the Home. The Province made financial contributions to the Home in the form of
grants, of differing amounts, to the Board of Trustees at various times
throughout the time period in question, as illustrated in Schedule &#147;C&#148;.</P>

agreement with the Federal Government under the Canada Assistance Plan, whereby
monies granted by the Province in relation to general welfare services within
the province would be reimbursed by the Federal Government up to 50%. The
grants to many private organizations, including the Home, were increased by the
Province at that time, as the Province had the opportunity to be reimbursed by
the Federal Government for up to 50% of the grants issued, and the Province
availed itself of this opportunity for the remaining years thereafter.</P>

restrictions, and with no accountability requirements for how the funds were
spent. The grants given in each year were a portion of the total monies
received by the Home in each year, and a portion of the annual operating
expenses incurred in each year. The use of the grant funds were solely at the
discretion of the Board of Trustees.</P>
